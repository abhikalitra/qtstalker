<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p></p>
Qtstalker is a basic end of day Technical Analysis package with many
features. It compares with similar commercial products like Metastok,
Superchartz, Tradestation(...maybe one day) etc. If you are familiar with
those, then you should be able to muddle along with Qtstalker. 

<p>The project has kept to a lean and simple design philosophy in order to
maximize speed, portability and resource usage.</p>

<h2><u>Chart - Exhaustion Points</u></h2>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> This chart type is experimental. See notes below.
</p>
<p>
"Outside Bars" (yellow-to-red) - the trading range encompasses the previous bar.
"Inside Bars" (pink-to-blue) - the trading range is encompassed by the previous bar.
</p>
<p>
May indicate short-term reversal.
Must be accompanied by volume and preceded by a trend.
</p>
<p>
The outside bar at 20030313 is a classic. It is even more strong as it
encompasses both previous bars and has a large body.

<h3>Ranking of bars</h3>
<p>Colour is used to denote the significance of bars. A five-point ranking
scheme is used as shown in the legend.</p>
<p>When an outside/inside bar is detected, it is assigned a default ranking
of one point. For each other significance factor, half a point is added.
The final rank is truncated to an integer between one and five.</p>
<p>Many factors contribute to significance. Here are the few that are
currently being used. 
</p>
<p>
Outside bars:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>encompass more (2, 3, 4) previous bars - add 0.5 each</li>
  <li>much bigger range than the previous bar (500%) - add 0.5</li>
  <li>much bigger range than the previous bar (900%) - add 0.5</li>
  <li>greater volume than the previous bar (150%) - add 0.5</li>
  <li>greater volume than the previous bar (300%) - add 0.5</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<p>
Inside bars:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>much smaller range than the previous bar (25%) - add 0.5</li>
  <li>much smaller range than the previous bar (10%) - add 0.5</li>
  <li>lesser volume than the previous bar (50%) - add 0.5</li>
  <li>lesser volume than the previous bar (20%) - add 0.5</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to apply more weight from your visual observations, e.g.
a sharper preceding trend.
</p>

<h3>Development notes</h3>
<p>Not yet automatically detecting that there is associated volume.
You must verify that visually.
</p>

<p>Not yet automatically detecting that an up or down trend is in place.
You must verify that visually.
</p>

<p>The ranking scheme needs to be fine-tuned, e.g. perhaps more weight should
be added to certain situations.
Note that you can tweak these weights yourself in Plot.cpp
(search for "Exhaustion or Rank").
</p>

<p>More significance patterns need to be detected - currently only doing a few.
(The maximum rank that can currently be achieved is three, i.e. you will not
yet see any orange or red outside bars nor any blue inside bars.)
</p>

<p>There are other price patterns that indicate exhaustion points,
e.g. two-bar reversals, exhaustion bars. However we are only attempting
outside and inside bars.

<h1>Qtstalker: Basic Installation</h1>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements and dependencies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A Linux or FreeBSD compatible or Mac OS X operating system.</li>
  <li><a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt</a> development library. At least Qt
    4.6 version.</li>
  <li><a href="http://qwt.sourceforge.net/">Qwt</a> graphics extension library.
    Version 5.2.x</li>
  <li><a href="http://ta-lib.org/">TA-Lib</a> Technical Analysis Library. At
    least ta-lib-0.3.0 version. See below.</li>
  <li>Supporting libraries for any programming language that you might use for
    script tools, e.g. Perl libwww, Perl Text::CSV
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When upgrading Qtstalker from a previous source version, see the <a
href="#upgrade">notes</a> below. </p>

<p>See notes below about <a href="#where">where</a> stuff gets installed. </p>
<a name="packages"></a> 

<h2 id="packages">Installing Qtstalker via packages</h2>

<p>Packages are available for some operating systems. (Warning: Packages are often out-of-date.)</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.zwets.com/qtstalker/">Debian packages</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="source"></a> 

<h2 id="source">Installing Qtstalker from source</h2>

<p>
The dependencies are easy to install from their source.
You might be able to install these using package managers. 
However use the examples of each dependency to ensure proper installation,
before complaining about Qtstalker.
</p>

<p><strong>Important (Qt):</strong> Ensure that Qt is installed properly.
Ensure that '<code>qmake</code>' and friends are available (e.g. add
<code>/path/to/qt/bin</code> to your <code>$PATH</code> <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable">environment
variable</a>).
Do '<code>which qmake</code>' and '<code>which lupdate</code>' etc. to ensure
that these are properly installed.
Ensure that the Qt '<code>qtdemo</code>' application can be started.
</p>

<p><strong>Important (Qwt):</strong> Ensure that Qwt is installed properly.
Ensure that its "examples" can be used.
Follow its installation
<a href="http://qwt.sourceforge.net/qwtinstall.html">instructions</a>,
especially about the "shared library" location.
</p>

<p><strong>Important (TA-Lib):</strong> Ensure that TA-Lib is installed
properly. Also ensure that the '<code>ta-lib-config</code>' program is
available on your <code>$PATH</code> environment variable. Do '<code>which
ta-lib-config</code>' to ensure that this is properly installed. </p>

<p>If you installed Qt or Qwt or TA-Lib at a non-standard location, then edit the
<code>qtstalker.config</code> file (e.g. "<code>INCLUDEPATH +=
/opt/local/include/ta-lib</code>"). </p>

<h3>Build and install Qtstalker</h3>

<p>See important pre-requisite notes <a href="#source">above</a>.</p>
<p>If you have non-standard locations for the dependencies or installation
locations, then see notes below about the <code>qtstalker.config</code> file
before running <code>configure</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>./configure</code> (this will create the Makefiles, etc.)</li>
  <li><code>make</code></li>
  <li><code>sudo make install</code> (i.e. as superuser)</li>
</ul>
<p>See additional instructions for <a href="install-macx.html">Mac OS X</a>.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Trouble building or running?</h2>

<h3 id="config">Non-standard locations for dependencies or installation</h3>
<p>
Perhaps there was trouble finding your supporting products, for example
if Qt or Qwt or TA-Lib is installed at a non-standard location, then edit the
<code>qtstalker.config</code> file to specify your locations
(e.g. "<code>INCLUDEPATH += /opt/local/include/ta-lib</code>") and then do
'<code>make distclean</code>' before doing the normal configure-and-make process.
</p>

<h3 id="qwt-lib">Supporting demos</h3>
<p>
Ensure that the Qt examples and Qwt examples and demonstrations can be utilised.
Unfortunately some package managers do not install these demos.
</p>
<p>
The most likely error is that the Qwt libraries cannot be found.
See <a href="#source">notes</a> above.
</p>

<h3 id="bit64">Building on 64-bit systems</h3>
<p>
First ensure that your Qt has been built for 64-bit systems. Recent versions do detect that automatically.
If your Qtstalker is having trouble, then try this: edit the Qtstalker "<code>configure</code>" file to tweak the
"qmake" invocation to include "CONFIG += qt x86_64"
</p>

<h3 id="ldconfig">Setting ldconfig</h3>

<p>On some Linux systems the following error might occur when you start Qtstalker ...</p>
<p><code>/usr/local/bin/qtstalker: error while loading shared libraries:
    libqtstalker.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
    directory</code></p>
    <p>Fix this by adding <code>/usr/local/lib</code>
    to your <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> file and run <code>ldconfig -v</code>
    (as root).</p>

<h3 id="clean">Clean build</h3>
<p>
If you have troubles, then clean up and start again. Do this:
</p>
<pre>
sudo make uninstall
make distclean
edit qtstalker.config (if necessary)
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre>
<p>
To completely clean your user workspace, do this before starting Qtstalker:
</p>
<pre>
rm -rf ~/.qtstalker
</pre>
<p>
You might also need to remove the user configuration settings files.
See <a href="#settings">notes</a> below.
</p>

<h2 id="where">Where does stuff get installed</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The executable 'qtstalker' will be copied to the
    <code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory</li>
  <li>The library will be copied to <code>/usr/local/lib</code> directory</li>
  <li>The translation files will be copied to
    <code>/usr/local/share/qtstalker/i18n</code> directory</li>
  <li>Some example indicator scripts will be copied to
    <code>/usr/local/share/qtstalker/indicator</code> directory</li>
  <li>The docs will be copied to
    <code>/usr/local/share/doc/qtstalker/html</code> directory (see toc.html
    for the table of contents)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Alternative installation locations can be configured in the
<code>qtstalker.config</code> file.
</p>

<p id="workspace">The user workspace is in your home at <code>~/.qtstalker/</code> directory.  </p>

<p id="settings">The user configuration settings on Linux systems is at <code>~/.qtstalkerrc/</code> file.
On Mac OS X it is held in preferences <a href="install-macx.html#where">plist</a> files.
</p>

<a name="upgrade"></a> 

<h2>Updating from a previous version</h2>

<p>If you are updating from a previous source version already installed on your
system, it is best that you first uninstall the previous version before you
build and install the upgraded version. Doing this will better ensure a problem-free
upgrade. Many upgrade errors can be caused by old plugins and libraries hanging
around complicating things. You can uninstall the old version by doing
<code>'sudo make uninstall'</code> from the top directory of the <b>old</b>
source install. Or if you had used a package manager to install the old version,
then use that to uninstall.</p>

<h2>Using the current development source</h2>

<p>See instructions for <a href="dev.html">using CVS</a>. </p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Use this function to install Qtstalker plugins. Only plugins that are
installed using this function will work. Currently, here are the types of
plugins available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indicator  - These are the indicators used like RSI, MACD etc.</li>
  <li>Quote - These are used for downloading or importing different kinds of
    quote data into Qtstalker.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>When this function is selected, you will be presented with a file dialog.
Use this dialog to navigate to where you have compiled the plugin. The plugin
must have a file descriptor of *.so to be recognized. Any plugins that have a
duplicate name will be overwritten.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Use this function to remove any unwanted plugins from Qtstalker. A file
selection dialog will display. Select any of the plugins you want removed and
press OK when finished. Do not try to select files other than from the
default directory or unexpected results will result. If you are not sure what
plugins to remove, than don't. It is better to just leave them be.</p>

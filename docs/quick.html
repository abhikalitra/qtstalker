<h2>Getting Started: A Quick Howto</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Connect to the internet.</li>
  <li>Open the quotes dialog from the toolbar.</li>
  <li>Select the Yahoo plugin. Select from the date calender the date you
    want quotes to begin from. The further back in time you go, the more
    history you get.</li>
  <li>Press the 'New Symbol' button. Enter as many ticker symbols as you want
    separated by commas. ie 'RHAT,IBM,MSFT' When done all the symbols you
    entered will appear in the symbol list.</li>
  <li>Press the download button, and the download will start. Depending on
    how fast your connection is this could take anywhere from 10 seconds to a
    few minutes. The data will be imported into Qtstalker when completed.</li>
  <li>Close the quotes dialog when download has completed. To load some
    charts, choose the work with charts dialog from the toolbar. You should
    see a list of the symbols you downloaded. Select a symbol to load by
    double clicking on it.</li>
  <li>To add indicators, open the new indicator dialog from the toolbar and
    choose an indicator from the list. The indicator dialog will open, just
    press OK for the default settings. Depending on the indicator, it will
    show up either in the main chart or in the indicator toolbar at the top
    far right. Press the button to display the indicator in the sub chart
    area. This should be enough to get you started for now, consult the
    documentation and play with the functions to become familiar with how
    Qtstalker works.</li>

<h2><u>Getting Started: A Quick Howto</u></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Connect to the internet.</li>
  <li>Open the quotes dialog from the toolbar.</li>
  <li>Select the Yahoo plugin. Press the configure 'Settings' button.
This will bring up the Yahoo Prefs dialog.<br>
  </li>
  <li>From the Yahoo Prefs dialog press the 'New Symbol' button from
the toolbar. This brings up the 'New Yahoo Symbols' dialog.<br>
  </li>
  <li>From the 'New Yahoo Symbols' dialog enter as many yahoo ticker
symbols
as you want separated by a space ie
'RHAT IBM MSFT'. When done, press the OK button.</li>
  <li>From the Yahoo Prefs dialog select 'Auto History' from the method
box. Press the 'Select All Symbols' from the toolbar. Press OK when
done.<br>
  </li>
  <li>From the Quotes dialog press the update button, and the download
will start. Depending
on how fast your connection is this could take anywhere from 10
seconds to a few minutes. The data will be imported into Qtstalker
when completed.</li>
  <li>Close the quotes dialog when download has completed. To load some
charts, select the chart panel button. You should see a directory
called
'Stocks'. This directory structure will contain the various stocks
downloaded. Navigate the Stocks directory and select a symbol to load
by double clicking on it.</li>
  <li>To add indicators, open the new indicator dialog from the toolbar
and choose an indicator from the list. The indicator dialog will open,
just press OK for the default settings. Depending on the indicator, it
will show up either in the main chart or as a tab in the lower section
of the window. This should be enough to get you started for now,
consult the documentation and play with the functions to become
familiar with how Qtstalker works.</li>

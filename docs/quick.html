<h2><u>Getting Started: A Quick Howto</u></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Connect to the internet.</li>
  <li>Open the quotes dialog from the toolbar.</li>
  <li>Select the Yahoo plugin. Press the "New Chart" button. Click on
the "New Symbols" item in the list.</li>
  <li>Enter as many ticker symbols as you want separated by a space ie
'RHAT IBM MSFT'. When done, press the OK button.</li>
  <li>Press the settings button. Select the start and end dates you
want quotes to include and press OK when done.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Press the update button, and the download will start. Depending
on how fast your connection is this could take anywhere from 10
seconds to a few minutes. The data will be imported into Qtstalker
when completed.</li>
  <li>Close the quotes dialog when download has completed. To load some
charts, select the chart panel button. You should see a directory
called
"Stocks". Select the directory. A list of the symbols you entered
earlier will appear. Select a symbol to load by clicking on it.</li>
  <li>To add indicators, open the new indicator dialog from the toolbar
and choose an indicator from the list. The indicator dialog will open,
just press OK for the default settings. Depending on the indicator, it
will show up either in the main chart or as a tab in the lower section
of the window. This should be enough to get you started for now,
consult the documentation and play with the functions to become
familiar with how Qtstalker works.</li>

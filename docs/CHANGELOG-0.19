This is a rush release to address some nasty bugs.

- There was a nasty bug that segfaulted on new installs and when trying to delete the last tabbed indicator.
  In trying to fix this I found an annoying limitation with the QTabWidget. In order to fix this I had to make
  a tabbed indicator page always visible in order to propagate resize signals properly.

- Adjusted the initial chart position by one bar due to some plots being partially truncated.

- I was unhappy with the all the tab function buttons causing limitations to resizing. I removed the buttons
  and replaced them with a context menu instead. Just right click with the mouse to bring it up. Doh!

- Changed the tab directory widgets to behave more like the standard directory dialogs. Double clicks to
  enter and leave sub directories instead of single clicks. Singles were creating some problems.

<h1>Work with Charts</h1>

<p></p>

<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>The work with charts dialog allows you to view, create, edit, delete
charts. Here is an example of large list of charts.</p>

<p>You may click on any of the header columns to sort the list. The columns
are defined as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Symbol is the ticker symbol of the chart</li>
  <li>Type is chart type. eg stock, futures, spread etc.</li>
  <li>First date is the first tick of data available to plot.</li>
  <li>Last date is the most recent tick of data to plot.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h2>Open Button:</h2>

<p>This will load and display the selected chart. eg ^IXIC</p>

<p></p>

<h2>New Button:</h2>

<p>Here you can create a new Composite type of chart. A composite is a chart
that is made up of other charts. Each symbol in the composite is given a
weight and then calculated depending on the type. The types are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Index - an average of all the symbols.</li>
  <li>Spread - 2 symbols only, it is simply the second symbol minus the first
    symbol.</li>
  <li>Ratio - 2 symbols only, it is the first symbol divided by the second
    symbol. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Selecting this will bring up a series of dialogs. First you are asked for
a name to call your new composite. The name must be unique, if not an error
message will display.</p>

<p><img alt="blah" src="workwithcharts2.png" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>After entering a new name, a second dialog will ask you to choose the
composite type to create.</p>

<p><img alt="blah" src="workwithcharts3.png" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>After selecting a composite type, a dialog that allows you to enter the
symbols and weights for the composite will appear. This dialog has 2 tabs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Settings tab allows you to edit the "Title" of the composite.</p>

<p><img alt="blah" src="workwithcharts4.png" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>The Composite List tab is where you add, delete and edit the weights and
symbols in the composite. A weight of 1 means 100%. A weight of 0.5 means
50%. A weight of 2 means 200%.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Edit Button:</h2>

<p>Opens a dialog that allows you to edit some of the chart parameters. Only
the parms listed can be edited. Parms are dependent on the chart types, so
not every chart shares the same parms.</p>

<p><img alt="blah" src="workwithcharts6.png" /></p>

<p></p>

<h2>Delete Button:</h2>

<p>Permanently delete the chart selected.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Export Button:</h2>

<p>Brings up a file selection dialog that allows you to dump the contents of
the selected files to ASCII. The exported files will be placed in the
Qtstalker export directory. The exported file is in the Qtstalker format of
key/data pairs, so it will not be useful for most of you. I include it for
use in correcting data errors and for disaster recovery operations. The
Qtstalker quote plugin can import this file format to rebuild the chart.
Don't do this unless you know what you are doing.</p>

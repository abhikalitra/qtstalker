<h2><u>Chart Panel<br>
</u></h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The chart tab allows you to view, edit, delete, export and search
charts. All
items that appear in the list can be either a chart or a directory. A
directory will have a blue folder icon beside the text. Selecting the
directory will move into it and update the list with the contents.
Selecting a chart will display it. At the top there is an&nbsp; entry
area where you can filter the list of stocks displayed in the list. ie.
^* would list all stocks starting with ^ Note: you must use the * at
the end of the search phrase to imply everything, otherwise a literal
search will be done.<br>

The context menu functions are as follows:<br>
</p>
<h4>New...</h4>
Use this function to create new types of securities. Not all types are
available, just user defined and custom types.<br>
<br>
<h4>Edit Chart</h4>
Opens a dialog that allows you to edit chart parameters
and bar data.
<p></p>
<h4><br>
</h4>
<h4>Delete Chart</h4>
<p>Permanently delete the chart selected.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Export Chart</h4>
This function will display a dialog that allows you to
select charts you wish to dump the contents to ASCII. The exported
files will be placed in the Qtstalker export directory. The exported
file is in the Qtstalker format of key/data pairs, so it will not be
useful for most of you. I include it for use in correcting data errors
and for disaster recovery operations. The Qtstalker quote plugin can
import this file format to rebuild the chart. Don't do this unless you
know what you are doing.

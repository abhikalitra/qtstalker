<h2><u>Chart Tab</u></h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The chart tab allows you to view, edit, delete, export charts. All
items that appear in the list can be either a chart or a directory. A
directory will have a blue folder icon beside the text. Selecting the
directory will move into it and update the list with the contents.
Selecting a chart will display it. Here is an example.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="chartnav.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 244px; height: 380px;"><br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The context menu functions are as follows:</p>
<h3><img src="edit.png" alt="" width="22" height="22"> Edit Chart</h3>
<p>Opens a dialog that allows you to edit some of the chart parameters
and chart data. Only  the parms listed can be edited. Parms are
dependent on the chart types, so  not every chart shares the same parms.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="blah" src="workwithcharts2.png"> <br>
</p>
<p>Here is where you can edit the tick data. Just select a date and the
data will display in the list. To edit a field, just click on the data
and a dialog will popup and allow to enter data. To save your changes
press the save button. To delete a record press the delete button.</p>
<p><img src="workwithcharts3.png" alt="" width="309" height="301"> <br>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3><img src="delete.png" alt="" width="22" height="22"> Delete Chart</h3>
<p>Permanently delete the chart selected.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><img src="export.png" alt="" width="22" height="22"> Export Chart</h3>
<p>Clicking this button will bring up a dialog that allows you to
select charts you wish to dump the contents to ASCII.  The exported
files will be placed in the Qtstalker export directory. The exported
file is in the Qtstalker format of key/data pairs, so it will not be
useful for most of you. I include it for use in correcting data errors
and for disaster recovery operations. The Qtstalker quote plugin can
import this file format to rebuild the chart. Don't do this unless you
know what you are doing.</p>

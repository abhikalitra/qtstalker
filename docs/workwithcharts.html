<h2><u>Chart Tab</u></h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The chart tab allows you to view, edit, delete, export and search
charts. All
items that appear in the list can be either a chart or a directory. A
directory will have a blue folder icon beside the text. Selecting the
directory will move into it and update the list with the contents.
Selecting a chart will display it. At the top there is an&nbsp; entry
area where you can filter the list of stocks displayed in the list. ie.
^* would list all stocks starting with ^ Note: you must use the * at
the end of the search phrase to imply everything, otherwise a literal
search will be done.<br>

<p>The context menu functions are as follows:</p>
<h3><img height="22" width="22" alt="" src="edit.png"> Edit Chart</h3>
<p>Opens a dialog that allows you to edit some of the chart parameters
and chart data. Only the parms listed can be edited. Parms are
dependent on the chart types, so not every chart shares the same parms.</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>Here is where you can edit the tick data. Just select a date and
time and press the 'search' button and the
data will display in the list. To edit a field, just select a field and
change the values directly. To save your changes
press the save button. To delete a record press the delete button.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<h3><img height="22" width="22" alt="" src="delete.png"> Delete Chart</h3>
<p>Permanently delete the chart selected.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><img height="22" width="22" alt="" src="export.png"> Export Chart</h3>
<p>Clicking this button will bring up a dialog that allows you to
select charts you wish to dump the contents to ASCII. The exported
files will be placed in the Qtstalker export directory. The exported
file is in the Qtstalker format of key/data pairs, so it will not be
useful for most of you. I include it for use in correcting data errors
and for disaster recovery operations. The Qtstalker quote plugin can
import this file format to rebuild the chart. Don't do this unless you
know what you are doing.</p>

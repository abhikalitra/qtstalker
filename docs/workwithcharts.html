<h1>Work with Charts</h1>

<p></p>

<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>The work with charts dialog allows you to open, create, edit, delete,
export charts. Here is an example of large list of charts.</p>

<p>Selecting a symbol from the list updates the current info on the chart:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Symbol is the ticker symbol of the chart</li>
  <li>Title is the name of the chart.</li>
  <li>Type is chart type. eg stock, futures, spread etc.</li>
  <li>First date is the first tick of data available to plot.</li>
  <li>Last date is the most recent tick of data to plot.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="work with charts dialog" src="workwithcharts1.png" /></p>

<p></p>

<h2>Open Button:</h2>

<p>This will load and display the selected chart. eg ^IXIC</p>

<p></p>

<h2>New Button:</h2>

<p>Here you can create a new Composite type of chart. A composite is a chart
that is made up of other charts. Each symbol in the composite is given a
weight and then calculated depending on the type. The types are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Index - an average of all the symbols.</li>
  <li>Spread - 2 symbols only, it is simply the second symbol minus the first
    symbol.</li>
  <li>Ratio - 2 symbols only, it is the first symbol divided by the second
    symbol. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Selecting this will bring up a series of dialogs. First you are asked for
a name to call your new composite. The name must be unique, if not an error
message will display.</p>

<p><img alt="blah" src="workwithcharts2.png" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>After entering a new name, a second dialog will ask you to choose the
composite type to create.</p>

<p><img alt="blah" src="workwithcharts3.png" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>After selecting a composite type, a dialog that allows you to enter the
symbols and weights for the composite will appear. Here we are creating an
index composite. Each setting is made up of 2 parameters, a symbol and
weight. ie. Parm 1 shows a setting of "^DJI 1". This means we are using
symbol ^DJI with a weight of 1. A weight of 1 means 100%. A weight of 0.5
means 50%. A weight of 2 means 200% etc. To edit the setting, just click on
it and a dialog will appear in which you may edit the symbol and weight.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Edit Button:</h2>

<p>Opens a dialog that allows you to edit some of the chart parameters. Only
the parms listed can be edited. Parms are dependent on the chart types, so
not every chart shares the same parms.</p>

<p><img alt="blah" src="workwithcharts6.png" /></p>

<p></p>

<h2>Delete Button:</h2>

<p>Permanently delete the chart selected.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Export Symbol Button:</h2>

<p>Clicking this button will dump the contents of the selected file to ASCII.
The exported file will be placed in the Qtstalker export directory. The
exported file is in the Qtstalker format of key/data pairs, so it will not be
useful for most of you. I include it for use in correcting data errors and
for disaster recovery operations. The Qtstalker quote plugin can import this
file format to rebuild the chart. Don't do this unless you know what you are
doing.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Export All Symbols Button:</h2>

<p>This is the same as the Export Symbol button except all charts in the list
will be exported.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Done Button:</h2>

<p>Closes the Work with Charts dialog.</p>

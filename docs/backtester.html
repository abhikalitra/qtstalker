<h2><u>Back Tester</u></h2>
  The back tester allows you to create trading rules using indicators to
buy and sell based on signals the indicators emit. You can then run "what
if" scenarios and then display the results in detail. Overall, you can use
the back tetser to test your ideas for profitability. The back tester dialog
contains several pages of options you use to create and fine tune your trading
rules. The page options are as follows:<br>
<br>
<a href="backtesterrules.html">Rules - This is where you select the indicators
to be used.</a><br>
<a href="backtesterstops.html">Stops - This is where you select the stops

</h3>
<br>
Qtstalker uses a seperate app for quote services called QuoteServer. It
runs in its own process space to minimize OS threading loads from the
main app. Qtstalker uses the QuoteServer API to communicate over
sockets using a text based API. Normally, QuoteServer will be started
and stopped by Qtstalker. For normal operation the user should just use
the default settings. However, users with the appropriate skills may
run QuoteServer on a network to serve Qtstalker clients if one were so
inclined. These docs do not explain those functions.<br>
<br>
Some of QuoteServer features are:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>server is completely multi-threaded</li>
  <li>uses only the Qt core library for dependancies</li>
  <li>uses sockets for IPC</li>
  <li>uses a text based API for simplicity and compatibility</li>
  <li>uses the sqlite sql engine for data storage</li>
  <li>plugin system for extendability</li>
</ul>
<br>
QuoteServer has a few command line switches. Run 'QuoteServer -h' to
see them. Qtstalker uses them when it starts up.<br>
<br>
The defaults for QuoteServer are in localhost mode listening on port
5000. If you need to change the port number, there is a dialog in
Qtstalker on the Charts panel. Press the configure button to display
the dialog.<br>

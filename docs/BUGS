Lurking in the shadows and corners.

- Sometimes when trying to download yahoo quotes, the plugin stalls on the first symbol and just sits there.
  The Qt networking is not timing out as it should. The work around is just cancel the download and try it again.
  It usually goes through on the second attempt. Not sure why this is happening, it seems to be a random bug.

- The yahoo quotes plugin has a big lag time for french quotes, not updating with the latest quote.

FIX:

Log scaling does not handle plots < 0. Need to add logic to handle it.

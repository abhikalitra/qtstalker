    <h1>Qtstalker: Documentation</h1>
    <p>
      This is documentation for the current version of Qtstalker.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE: The documentation has not yet been fully updated from the
      previous version. A warning has been added to the right-hand side of
      every document. As each document is updated, that warning is removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Documentation can be viewed with a web browser, by opening
      <code>/usr/local/share/doc/qtstalker/index.html</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Documentation can also be viewed via the Qt Assistant application, by
      selecting from the Qtstalker "Help" menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE: Qt Assistant has a bug. If you see a blank page or Assistant
      crashes, then you need to remove the file "doc.qhc" from the
      documentation cache. This location is reported to the console when
      Assistant starts. Remove that file and select "Help" again.

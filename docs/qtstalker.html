<h2>Qtstalker Plugin</h2>

<p></p>

<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>This will allow you to import ASCII data that was exported only by
Qtstalker previously. Qtstalker has an export function that dumps the chart
from key/data binary data into a ASCII file. This plugin can read this data
back in and re-create the chart. This plugin is only useful for fixing data
problems or disaster recovery functions. I have included it for those
purposes. The new charts will appear in the data/import directory, it's up to
you to move them into the appropriate directory.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Input Parameters:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Input - The file(s) to import.</li>
</ul>

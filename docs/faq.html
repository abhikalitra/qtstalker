<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p></p>
<h4>Can you make a binary package for Qtstalker ?</h4>
No. Binary packages are problematic to maintain. I will
leave it
up to the distributions to provide binaries and support them. Besides,
learning
how to compile from source makes you a better person, brings world
peace and
makes you more attractive to women. Qtstalker is available in several
distributions. Please consult your distribution for available packages.
<p></p>
<h4><br>
</h4>
<h4>What platforms are supported ?</h4>
<p>Currently, Linux compatible, FreeBSD and Mac OS X systems are
supported.
Some people have tried with some success on Solaris, IRIX and most
unices. Due
to virtualization software rapidly maturing, there is really no need to
port
software anymore. For a small performance hit, you can run software in
its own
native environment with all of the benefits and none of the headaches
of
porting. I encourage users (THIS MEANS YOU WINDOWS USERS) to install
virtualbox or vmware on your OS of choice, install Ubuntu and run
qtstalker
hassle free.

<h4>My favorite indicator(s) are not included in Qtstalker, what can I
do ?</h4>
Offers of beer or cash tend to work best, but you might also try asking
me. Provided I have the time, I
would be glad to create a script or plugin for you provided you supply
me with a formula
and you agree to include it into Qtstalker under the GPL. Another
option is if
you don't want to GPL your formula, you may contract me to write a
proprietary
script or plugin for you for a fee.
<p></p>
<p>Of course, you can always develop the new indicator yourself. Just
copy code
from an existing indicator that does similar things and modify it to
suit your
needs. Please consider contributing the new indicator back to this
project.
Everyone benefits.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another option is to contribute to the <a href="talib.html">TA-Lib</a>
Technical Analysis Library project. Qtstalker provides access to the
library.

<h4>What versions of documentation are available?</h4>
<p>The <a href="dev.html">CVS</a> (i.e. next version in development)
has the
most up-to-date documentation. The <a
 href="http://qtstalker.sourceforge.net">website</a> reflects CVS. </p>
<p>Each released version has its own copy of the documentation in the
"docs"
directory. This is usually installed at
<code>/usr/local/share/doc/qtstalker/html/</code> so use your web
browser to
view its index.html file. The "Help" items in the application also
refer to
this local documentation. </p>

<h4><br>
</h4>
<h4>Does Qtstalker handle stock splits ?</h4>
No. It is up to the user to manage their own data.<br>
<br>
<h4><br>
</h4>
<h4>Where does the name Qtstalker come from ?</h4>
Well if you really must know...The Qt part comes from the GNU/Linux
tradition
of prefixing an X11 app with the GUI toolkit used. The stalker part is
just
cheesy word play stemming from the idea of "stock search" or "stalking
stocks".
I also just like the word "stalker".<br>
<br>
In english, Qt sounds like 'cutie' which is slang for 'a cute woman'.
So now we
have 'cutie stalker' which in all honesty was completely unintentional.
Now if
someone were to write a 'cutie stalker' indicator plugin we just might
really
be on to something ;-)<br>
<br>
<h4><br>
</h4>
<h4>Can you make qtstalker into a KDE app ?</h4>
No. We want to keep things as simple, efficient and portable as
possible. KDE is a terrific environment, but using it would create an
additional layer that could lock out a some users ie. OSX. Qt
does everything we need.

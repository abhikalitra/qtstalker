<h2><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></h2>
       
<h2>  </h2>
          
<h3>Can you make a binary package for Qtstalker ?</h3>
          
<p>Nope. Binary packages are so problematic now that they are a nightmare
  for maintainers. I will leave it up to the distributions to provide binaries
  and support them. Besides, learning how to compile from source makes you
 a better person, brings world peace and makes you more attractive to women.</p>

<h3>What platforms are supported ?</h3>
          
<p>Currently, Linux compatible systems are supported. Some people have tried
with some success on Solaris, IRIX and most unices. I'm afraid I cannot
support any other platforms other than Linux compatible systems simply because I
do not have the time or resources to maintain other operating systems. So,
if you want to port it, I can help as much as I am able. Due to ethical and
 political feelings, I will not help or support anyone trying to do a win32
 port. The goal of this project is not to provide win32 users more gold bars
 for their prisons. So endith the lesson...</p>

<h3>My favorite indicator(s) are not included in Qtstalker, what can I do 
  ?</h3>
          
<p>Beer and cash tend to work best, but you might also try asking me. I'd
  be glad to create a plugin for you provided you supply me with a formula
 and you agree to include it into Qtstalker under the GPL. Another option
is if you don't want to GPL your formula, you may contract me to write a
proprietary plugin for you for a fee.</p>

<h3>I'm a day trader, how come there is no intraday charting functions ?</h3>
          
<p>Qtstalker is an 'end of day' analysis tool. Personally I have no interest 
  in day trading, I prefer to trade positions, and since this project arose
  to fill my personal needs there are none. So, I have no plans to add them.
  If someone wants to add these functions, I would gladly help out if needed.
  It would be possible without too much difficulty. Anyway, you need real
time  quotes, and real time quotes need proprietary software to decrypt them, 
 and  if you can afford to day trade, then you can afford real time quotes 
 and the $ for the software. So there. Besides, are you sure you want to sit
 in front of a screen all day when you could be getting a life ?</p>

<h3>Does Qtstalker handle stock splits ?</h3>
   Nope. To keep things simple, there is an easy way to handle splits. Just 
 delete the chart that had a split, create the chart with the yahoo plugin 
 and then update the data. This will pull in all the new corrected data. Nice
 and simple. Yes, a little more work for the user but reduces overhead and
 keeps things nice and snappy. <br>
   <br>
     
<h3>Where does the name Qtstalker come from ?</h3>
  Well if you really must know...The Qt part comes from the GNU/Linux tradition
 of prefixing an X app with the GUI toolkit used. The stalker part is just
 cheesy word play stemming from the idea of "stock search" or "stalking stocks".
 I also just like the word "stalker" being the title of my favourite movie
 of all time.<br>
  <br>
   
<h3>Why don't you make this into a KDE app ?</h3>
  I want to keep things as simple, efficient and portable as possible. Qt 
does everything I need.<br>
 <br>
 
<h3>There are alot of plugins I don't use taking up space. How do I get rid
of them ?</h3>
If you are sure there are plugins you don't need, then all you have to do
is delete them from the ~/Qtstalker/plugins/* directory. Simple as that.
Be sure you don't delete the directory itself, just the plugin *.so file.<br>

<p>Here we will be adding MSFT, IBM, RHAT to our database. Leave a

<p>NOTE: You only have to create the symbols once and not every time
you want to download quotes. They will be updated every time choose the
update function.<br>
</p>
<p>Adjustments: Yahoo provides an Adjusted Close column in its data,
scaling prior closing prices to the most recent price based on stock
splits and dividends. For example, if a 2-for-1 split occurs halfway
through the data, the Adjusted Close price from before the split will
be half of the Close price. If the Adjustments option is checked, the
plugin will calculate the factor between the Close price and the
Adjusted Close price and apply it to Open, Close, High, Low, and
Volume. It divides the prices and multiplies the volume, so in any
case Close x Volume is the same as before the conversion. This allows
you to display continuous graphs and analyze the movement of an issue
without large jumps due to stock splits, although the caveat is that
absolute prices are a factor different from what occurred on the
exchange that day. Having said that, factoring for historical events
in this manner is a common approach for visually graphing stock
prices.</p>

<h3><a name="adjustmentdetail">More detailed explanation about the
adjustment
option</a> </h3>
<p>Yahoo provides an Adjusted Close column in its data, scaling prior
closing
prices to the most recent price based on stock splits and dividends.
For
example, if a 2-for-1 split occurs halfway through the data, the
Adjusted
Close price from before the split will be half of the Close price. If
the
Adjustments option is checked, the plugin will calculate the factor
between
the Close price and the Adjusted Close price and apply it to Open,
Close,
High, Low, and Volume. It divides the prices and multiplies the volume,
so in
any case Close x Volume is the same as before the conversion. This
allows you
to display continuous graphs and analyze the movement of an issue
without
large jumps due to stock splits, although the caveat is that absolute
prices
are a factor different from what occurred on the exchange that day.
Having
said that, factoring for historical events in this manner is a common
approach for visually graphing stock prices. </p>

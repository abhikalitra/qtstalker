<a name="add"></a>
<h3>Add new stocks to the Qtstalker database </h3>
<p>Pressing the "New Symbol" button&nbsp;<img alt=""
 src="../pics/newchart.xpm"><img alt="" src="newchart.png"
 style="width: 22px; height: 22px;"> will bring up
the following dialog. </p>
<p><img src="yahoonewsymbols.png"> </p>
<p>Here we will be adding RHT, AAPL and IBM to our database. Leave a
space
between the symbols. </p>
<p>NOTE: You only have to create the symbols once and not every time
you want
to download quotes. </p>
<p>To find out the correct Yahoo symbol name for the stock of your
desire,
search the stock at the yahoo finance portal and take a look at the
upper
left corner in the displayed chart. US stocks do not have a suffix at
the end
like .DE for stocks traded at Xetra or .L for London Stock Exchange. </p>
<p><img src="yahoosymbolfindout.png"> </p>
<p>Symbols can be lowercase (e.g bhp.ax) or uppercase (e.g. BHP.AX) - it doesn't matter, but be consistent.
</p>
<h3>Perform quote download </h3>
<p>After you have made all adjustments in the GUI press the download
button
<img src="download.png"> and the process starts. If an error occurs, it will
be
displayed in the status window. </p>
<p>If you want to abort the download for any reason, press the cancel
button
<img src="canceldownload.png"> which is only available while a download
is
in progress. </p>
<a name="download"></a>
<h3>Detailed explanation of downloading</h3>
<p>
See the <a href="quick.html">Quickstart</a> documentation for an overview.
</p>
<p>
Add a <a href="#add">new symbol</a> as described above (e.g. BHP). Download
some historical end-of-day data using the "History" method. This only needs to
be done once. However if you have subsequent trouble with downloading, you
might need to delete a symbol and download its history again.
</p>
<p>
After the close of the market each day, use the "Auto History" method.
This will automatically retrieve end-of-day data for each day to bring you
up-to-date. Be aware of market closing times and <a href="#avail">data
availability</a>.
</p>
<p>
While the market is open, the "Quote" method can be used to obtain a snapshot
of today's current trading (20-minute delayed). However, again be aware of 
<a href="#avail">data availability</a> for your particular exchange.
</p>
<a name="avail"></a>
<h3>Market closing times and data availability</h3>
<p>
Yahoo publishes the end-of-day data some time after each exchange closes.
</p>
<p>
North American exchanges seem to be available around 01:00 UTC which is about
5 hours after NYSE close.
</p>
<p>
All other exchanges seem to be available around 13:00 UTC. For example, for
Australia and London, yesterday's data will not be available before the
exchange opens. Note that this causes difficulty using the Quote method
because you will be missing yesterday's data.
</p>
<p>
See a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_market_opening_times">list</a> of market opening times and closing times.
</p>
<h3><a name="adjustmentdetail">Detailed explanation about the
adjustment
option</a> </h3>
<p>Yahoo provides an Adjusted Close column in its data, scaling prior
closing
prices to the most recent price based on stock splits and dividends.
For
example, if a 2-for-1 split occurs halfway through the data, the
Adjusted
Close price from before the split will be half of the Close price. If
the
Adjustments option is checked, the plugin will calculate the factor
between
the Close price and the Adjusted Close price and apply it to Open,
Close,
High, Low, and Volume. It divides the prices and multiplies the volume,
so in
any case Close x Volume is the same as before the conversion. This
allows you
to display continuous graphs and analyze the movement of an issue
without
large jumps due to stock splits, although the caveat is that absolute
prices
are a factor different from what occurred on the exchange that day.
Having
said that, factoring for historical events in this manner is a common
approach for visually graphing stock prices. </p>

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Misc. Plugin - CSV<br>
</h3>
This plugins allow users to import CSV (Comma Separated Values) quote
files into the QuoteServer. <br>
<br>
Firstly the user creates a 'rule' that describes the format of the CSV
file they want to import. The new/edit rule dialog has 2 sections. The
first deals with general details such as the record delimiter, the file
location etc. The second section deals with the actual field structure
of each record in the file which must be identical. Once the rule is
created and saved, the user would then 'Run' the rule and hopefully
everything works right the first time. If you are new to this, it may
take a few attempts before you figure things out.<br>

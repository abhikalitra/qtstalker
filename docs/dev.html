<h2><u>Using CVS to keep on the bleeding edge</u></h2>

<p>The source code is maintained in Concurrent Version System (CVS) at
SourceForge. To get your local working copy of the current codebase, you can
go to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtstalker/">sourceforge
page</a> and select the link in the Navigation bar to "CVS". Follow the
instructions to get your local working copy installed. </p>

<p>Or simply enter (copy&amp;paste) the following in a terminal that will
create the folder <em>qtstalker</em> in your actual working directory and
download the latest version into it.</p>

<p><code>cvs -z3
-d:pserver:anonymous@qtstalker.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/qtstalker
checkout qtstalker</code></p>

<p>If you get an error like <code>command not found</code> you have to
install <em>cvs</em>. Ubuntu/Debian users have simply to install the package
<em>cvs</em></p>

<p>To build this version just do exactly the same as you would to <a
href="install.html">build</a> a release tarball. Now edit some source code,
build, install, see your changes, and send the project a Patch to incorporate
your wonderful new features. </p>

<p>You could keep two versions on your system - a "stable" version and a
"test" version. Both versions can be from CVS if you like, as long as you
deem one of them stable. Flipping back and forth between versions is just a
matter of installing one over the other. A <tt>'make install'</tt> will
overwrite everything except your data and preferences. If you find that the
test version has problems, then just install the stable version. As a
precaution, backup your ~/.qtstalker directory and your ~/.qt/qtstalkerrc file
before installing a test version, so that you have a clean data tree to
revert to in case of data corruption. You should never get data corruption
anyway, but as always it is better to be safe. </p>

<h2><u>Contributing patches to the project</u></h2>

<p>Contributions are the life-blood of a community project. You can
contribute in many ways, such as: discussion on the mailing list; helping
other users; describing any problems that you might perceive; suggesting
enhancements; and sending patches for code or documentation. </p>

<p>A "patch" is a text file showing just the differences between your version
and the version in the central repository. To create a patch, use... </p>

<p><code>cvs -q update -dP<br>
cvs diff -u &gt; mypatch.diff</code> </p>

<p>...and add it via the tracker option at the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtstalker/">sourceforge page</a>. If
you have a lot of files, then tar and gzip them. </p>

<p>Of course you do not need CVS just to send a patch. If you are using a
release version then make a backup copy of the original file and do...</p>

<p><code>diff -u file.html.orig file.html &gt; mypatch.diff</code> </p>

<h2><u>More information about CVS</u></h2>

<p>...you will find at the <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/">CVS
Book</a> and many more links e.g at <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">wikipedia.org</a></p>

<h2><u>Apply a Patch</u></h2>

<p>If there are new patches posted in the Tracker section, which are currently not included
in the cvs tree, you can download them into your source root, e.g.
~/qtstalker, and patch you sources by hand. Change into your ~/qtstalker
source directory and apply the new patch with the command</p>

<p><code>patch -u -p0 -i <em>downloaded-patchfile.diff</em></code></p>

<p>But normally you will update your cvs sources with the already above
mentioned command</p>

<p><code>cvs -q update -d</code></p>

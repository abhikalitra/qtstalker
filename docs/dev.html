<h1>Using CVS to keep on the bleeding edge</h1>

<p>The source code is maintained in Concurrent Version System (CVS) at
SourceForge.</p>

<p>
To get your local working copy of the current codebase, go to the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtstalker/develop">sourceforge
page</a>. Follow the instructions to get your local working copy downloaded.
Use the "modulename" of "<code>qtstalker</code>" to get the trunk of our
development code.
</p>

<p>If you get an error like "<code>command not found</code>" then you need to
install
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">CVS</a>".
</p>

<p>To build this version of Qtstalker, just do exactly the same as you would to <a
href="install.html">build</a> a release tarball. Now edit some source code,
build, install, see your changes, and send the project a Patch to incorporate
your wonderful new features. </p>

<p>Subscribe to the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=25632">qtstalker-cvs-commits</a>
mailing list. This read-only list keeps you informed about the daily changes.
Especially notice the modifications to docs/CHANGELOG.* </p>

<p>
If there are major changes, then do the following clean,
then proceed to do the normal 'configure and make' process:
</p>
<pre>sudo make uninstall
make distclean
</pre>

<p>
From time-to-time you may also need to remove your user home directory with
'<code>rm -rf ~/.qtstalker'
</p>

<p>
Browse the CVS repository and the changes with
<a href="http://qtstalker.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qtstalker/qtstalker/">ViewCVS</a>.
</p>

<p>
The "CVS Utilities" (<a href="http://red-bean.com/cvsutils/">cvsutils</a>)
package is very useful. For example, doing 'cvsu' shows local modifications.
</p>

<p>You could keep two versions on your system - a "stable" version and a "test"
version. Both versions can be from CVS if you like, as long as you deem one of
them stable. Flipping back and forth between versions is just a matter of
installing one in place of the other.
Just remember to do '<code>sudo make uninstall</code>' etc. from the
corresponding working copy.
</p>

<p>
 A <tt>'make install'</tt> will overwrite
everything except your data and preferences. If you find that the test version
has problems, then just install the stable version. As a precaution, backup
your ~/.qtstalker directory and user preferences
(see <a href="install.html#where">notes</a>)
before installing a
test version, so that you have a clean data tree to revert to in case of data
corruption. You should never get data corruption anyway, but as always it is
better to be safe. </p>

<h2 id="patch">Contributing patches to the project</h2>

<p>Contributions are the life-blood of a community project. You can contribute
in many ways, such as: discussion on the mailing list; helping other users;
describing any problems that you might perceive; suggesting enhancements; and
sending patches for code or documentation. </p>

<p>A "patch" is a text file showing just the differences between your version
and the version in the central repository. To create a patch, use... </p>
<pre>cd /local/cvs/qtstalker
cvs -q update -dP
cvs diff -u &gt; mypatch.txt</pre>

<p>...and add it via the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=25632">Tracker</a>
option at the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtstalker/">sourceforge page</a>.
If you
have other files to be added, then tar and gzip them. Please describe the
purpose of your patch.</p>

<p>Of course you do not need CVS just to send a patch. If you are using a
release version then make a backup copy of the original file and do...</p>

<p><code>diff -u file.html.orig file.html &gt; mypatch.txt</code> </p>

<h2 id="cvs-info">More information about CVS</h2>

<p>See the <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/">CVS Book</a> and many more
links e.g. at <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">wikipedia.org</a></p>

<h2 id="patch-apply">Apply a Patch</h2>

<p>If there are new patches posted in the Tracker section, which are currently
not included in the cvs tree, you can download them and apply them to your
sources (i.e. patch) by hand. Change into your /local/cvs/qtstalker source
directory and apply the new patch with the command:</p>

<p><code>patch -u -p0 -i
path/to/<em>downloaded-patchfile-diff.txt</em></code></p>

<p>But normally you would wait until they are committed to CVS and then update
your cvs sources with the abovementioned command:</p>

<p><code>cvs -q update -d</code></p>

<h2 id="docs">Enhancing documentation</h2>

<p>The intention is to keep the documentation as simple as possible and link to
tadoc.org where relevant. </p>

<p>Edit docs in docs/*.html and view them immediately in your web browser using
the <code>file://</code> protocol.</p>

<p>To create a new document, copy the <code><a
href="doc-template.html">doc-template.html</a></code> file. </p>

<p>NOTE: The documentation has not yet been fully updated from the previous
version. A warning has been added to the right-hand side of every document. As
each document is updated, that warning is removed by removing the <code>&lt;div
id="warnDoc"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> element. </p>

<p>See other info about the "indicator docs" help system.</p>

- Feature request #824930 applied. Moved html docs into /usr/share/doc/qtstalker/html

- Fixed bug #824922 - License is GPL not LGPL.

- Thanks to Marco van Zwetselaar for creating a Debian package. Marco is working on getting qtstalker into the main Debian
  distribution. This is exciting news.

- Fixed bug #825827 - MySQL plugin RH9 compile problem.

- Repackaged the db source to minimize size.

- Removed the CBOT plugin code. Given up hope for a work around.

- Added DDMMYYYY date format to the CSV plugin. Also added auto detection for date field delimiters (/-.).

- Fixed bug #830024 - single-click versus double-click with SymbolDialog.

- Fixed bug #830357 - synchronised cross-hairs, data values were switched.

- Added ability to stack indicators or add them to the tabs. Now you can view more than one tabbed indicator at a time.

- Changed the new indicator dialog. Combined several steps and dialogs into one. Introduces an option to put the
  indicator in either the tabs or stackable.

- Added a search function to the workwith charts tab.

- Added a new field format for the CSV plugin. SDOHLCV files can now be imported.

- Changed trend line dialog and creation functions to better handle extending them without user intervention.
  There are now 2 value options for the start and end points. You can either use the bar data OHLC or specify a value.
  The "Use Bar" toggle selects the bar fields to be used instead of a specific value. Trend lines will
  automatically extend as bars are added to the chart.

- Added Point and Figure chart options to the preferences dialog. "P&F Box Size" determines the size of
  each box, leaving this value at zero uses the default box sizing formula. "P&F Reversal" indicates
  the number of boxes before a reversal takes place. The default is 3.

- Applied patch #834376 - enhance chart search and tooltip.

- Lowered the minimum bar spacing to 3 for line charts as per request.

- Applied patch #836996 - changelog shows a bit more detail

- Applied patch #837617 - patch to create libqtstalker.so. Kudos to Marco van Zwetselaar for moving the shared classes into a
  library. This has reduced the size of the executable and plugins by as much 2 thirds! Great patch Marco, we are back on track
  to being lean and mean.

- Fixed the Index plugin. Was not populating the chart with data due to bad symbol paths.

- Tweaked the plot crosshairs to draw faster and y axis duplication if possible.

- Moved the plugin management functions into Config class. Changed the plugins to stay opened and available
  instead of opening and closing all the time. Better speed. Maybe OSX will work with this arrangement.
  Added a Plugin::clearOutput() function to minimize memory use with open plugins.

- Added new indicator plugin THERM. Thanks to patch #843533 from Martin Flack.

- Added function to PlotLine class to color individual histogram bars. VOL and THERM plugins now use this.

- Fixed a bug with CC quote plugin. It was not calculating forward contracts properly on some symbols.

- Applied patch #845558 - Elder's Safezone stop - new indicator SZ from Martin Flack.

- Had to back out of keeping plugins open. Was causing problems with persistant settings losing values. The speed difference
  was actually pretty small, so no big loss here.

- Commented out all LIBS += -L/usr/lib references in all plugins and src *.pro files. This was causing a problem on some
  distributions when compiling. The old /usr/lib/libqtstalker was being linked instead of the newly compiled library in
  the source tree. This shows up as undefined references to functions when make tries to link the qtstalker binary to the
  old library instead of the new library. Hopefully, this will fix it.

- App now saves and restores window height, width, x and y positions.

- Bar position is restored if chart is reloaded. No longer resets to the last bar.

- Changed chart type name from "Point and Figure" to "P&F" to help shorten the width of the chart type
  combobox.

- Added a new functions Plugin::getPluginSettings and Setting::merge to better manipulate settings.

- Modified a few functions in QtstalkerApp to refresh the chart much faster when modifying indicators. The old method
  would just reload the whole chart. The new method refreshes just the indicator.
  
- Applied patch #860795 - fix for indicator setting bug.

- Modified the drawing routines for Plot::drawXGrid, Plot::getXFromDate to increase speed.

- Added ability to print charts chart popup menus. Have not tested this, hope it works properly...

- Applied patch #872874 - apply yahoo adjusted close column. Essentially the yahoo plugin can now do
  adjusted splits for stocks. Consult the docs for the details on how this works. Thanks to Martin Flack
  for this great patch.

- Applied patch #872878 - double size of the MACD osc. Was appearing too small on some charts for easy viewing.

- Applied patch #872881 - chart WILLR with 100 at bottom. This fixes the scaling to be faithful to the
  original method. Values are converted to negative values in order to plot properly.

- Added a flag to PlotLine to ignore shared scaling and scale relative to itself. Changed MACD plugin
  to use this flag for the osc plot. Only minor flaw is the zero position for histograms does not match
  up with the visible scale. Best use of this flag is for small ranges in multiple plots so that they
  can better be seen by the user.

- Added a new Scaler class for use in plotting flexibility. This is a utility class. 

- 20040118: Updated copyright notice and cleaned up .pro files for quote plugins.

- 20040121: Updated copyright notice and cleaned up .pro files for indicator plugins.

- 20040122: Moved the chart popup menu creation routines to Plot class. This also has the effect of
            the popup menu listing only chart objects and indicators that apply to the chart clicked
	    on.

- 20040123: Updated the docs. Getting ready for the 0.23 release.

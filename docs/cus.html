<h2><u>Custom - CUS</u></h2>
<h4>Description:</h4>
Allows the user to create custom indicators to plot. The user builds an
indicator in a step by step manner.<br>
By using all the indicator plugins available, we are able to build
most any
kind of indicator quickly and simply. Complicated, intensive indicators
would best be
left
to creating a plugin instead of long series of functions for speed and
memory considerations.<br>
<br>
<h4>Formula Page:</h4>
This is where we enter our script. We break our script down into steps.
Each step basically defines a&nbsp; variable. Each variable represents
the results of an indicator command. The format of the variable command
is:<br>
<br>
&lt;variable&gt; := &lt;indicator&gt;(indicator parameters)<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;variable&gt; - The variable name. It cannot contain a
reserved word.</li>
  <li>:= - This separates the variable name from the parms and lets the
parser know we are defining a variable</li>
  <li>&lt;indicator&gt;(indicator parameters) - This defines what
indicator and its parameters to use. Consult the indicator reference
for the format of each indicator.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
Here is an example of what the MACD indicator would look like if we
constructed one manually instead of using the builtin version.<br>
<br>
macd := TALIB(MACDFIX, Close, 9)<br>
trig := TALIB(EMA, macd, 9)<br>
osc := UTIL(SUB, macd, trig)<br>
<br>
Lets review what we did. The first line creates a variable called
'macd'. We use the TALIB indicator to get a MACD using the MACDFIX
function. The next line we
create a variable called 'trig'. This will be the trigger of the MACD,
which is just an EMA of the MACD. So we use the TALIB plugin again and
request
an 9 period EMA of the 'macd'. Notice we use the variable 'macd' as the
input for the 'trig'. The last line we create a variable called 'osc'.
This is an oscillator. An oscillator is simply the difference between 2
variables. So we need to use the UTIL plugin that contains a
subtraction (SUB) function. We input the parms to get an oscillator of
(macd - trig). That's it.<br>
<br>
For a description of some types used. See <a href="ctypes.html">here.</a><br>
<h4>Plot Page:</h4>
On this page we decide which variables from the formula page we choose
to plot on our chart. Each plot command has 4 parameters. The format of
the plot command is:<br>
<br>
plot (&lt;var&gt;, &lt;color&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, &lt;plot type&gt;)<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>&lt;var&gt; - This is the variable name used in the formula page.</li>
  <li>&lt;color&gt; - The color the plot should use.</li>
  <li>&lt;title&gt; - The text label the plot will use.</li>
  <li>&lt;plot type&gt; - The plot type to use. ie Line, Histogram etc.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
From our MACD example it looks like this:<br>
<br>
plot(osc, blue, OSC, Histogram)<br>
plot(macd, red, MACD, Line)<br>
plot(trig, yellow, TRIG, Dash)<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the user does not need to input the plot format manually.
We can use the 'insert' dialog to construct the plot paramaters for us
correctly.<br>
<br>
<h4>Reserved Words:</h4>
These words and symbols are reserved for use in CUS scripts. Do not use
these words and symbols in or part of variable names or the script will
fail or become unstable.<br>

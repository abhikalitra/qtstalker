<h3> Description:</h3>
Allows the user to create custom indicators to plot. The user builds an
indicator in a step by step manner. Using the above pic as an example
to build a copy of the built in MACD indicator manually. Here is a
breakdown of each step:<br>
<br>
1. We use a REF step to create an array of close bar fields. This will
be used as the input data that later steps will build on. We don't
check the plot column because we don't want to plot this.<br>
2. We use a MACD step with step 1 as the input. We check the plot
column so our MACD step will appear.<br>
3. We use a MA to create the trigger plot by applying an EMA using step
2 as
the input. We check this to appear on the plot.<br>
4. We use a MATH (subtraction) function to build a histogram
of the MACD and trigger plots by subtracting step 3 from step 2. We
check this to appear on the plot.<br>
<br>
By using all the indicator plugins available, we are able to build
almost any
kind of indicator quickly and simply without having to learn a new
scripting language. Complicated, intensive indicators would best be
left
to creating a plugin instead of long series of functions for speed and
memory considerations.<br>

<h3> Description:</h3>
Allows the user to create custom indicators to plot. The user builds an
indicator in a step by step manner. Using the above pic as an example
to build a copy of the built in MACD indicator manually. The first
function uses a MACD. We check the Plot
column here if we want this particular function to appear on the plot.
Step 2 then creates the trigger plot by applying an EMA using step 1 as
the input. We also want to plot this. Step 3 then builds a histogram
of&nbsp; the MACD and trigger plots by subtracting step 2 from step 1
using the SUB function. We check this to plot as well.<br>
<br>
By using all the indicator plugins available, we are able to build
almost any
kind of indicator quickly and simply without having to learn a new
scripting language. Complicated intensive indicators would best be left
to creating a plugin instead of long series of functions for speed and
memory considerations.<br>

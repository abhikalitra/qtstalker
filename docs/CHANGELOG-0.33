20050831: Fixed CSV plugin to ignore delimiter chars in date fields

20050831: Fixed bars to load spinbox mouse scrolling problem. Replaced spinbox with a textbox.
          User must now enter numbers with keyboard and press enter key to make change official.

20050831: New indicator dialog now defaults to last used indicator.

20050905: Removed the MySQL plugin from the distribution. There will be officially no support
          for software authors/owners of products whose behaviour is disrespectful and harmful
          to the OSS community. Sorry Marco, I know a lot of users appreciated the work you did
          to support it. I will be looking at a possible postgres replacement in the future. 

20050906: Applied patch that adds a text option to the HorizontalLine plugin. Thanks to Michal
          for the patch.

20050906: Applied patch #1283054 - delete dupe symbol in portfolio. Thanks to imoszarh for the patch.

20050906: Applied patch #1283036 - show portfolio balance in percent. Thanks to imoszarh for the patch.

20050907: Applied patch #1283865 - float to double type migration. Thanks to imoszarh for the patch.

20050908: NYBOT changed download url. Updated NYBOT plugin.

20050908: PortfolioDialog was not updating after item is deleted. Fixed.

20050909: Fixed MADialog focus.

20050909: Changed COMP plugin 'then' parm default to true.

20050912: Added a 'Delete Chart' parm to the QtstalkerFormat plugin.

20050919: Added "qt" config option to the src/src.pro file. Fix for strange qmake bug on some systems.

20050919: Updated pl translation files from Benedict.
  
20051003: Applied patch #1311897 - AROON indicator. Thanks to Flynn for the patch.

20051004: Applied patch #1312718 - AROON indicator fix. Thanks to Flynn for the patch.

20051006: Added Chaikin Oscillator method to the AD plugin.

20051006: Added Chaikin Money Flow method to the AD plugin.

20051006: New Indicator VOLA - volatility. This contains the new Chaikin Volatility indicator, SD indicator,
          and the VOLR indicator.

20051006: Removed the SD, VOLR plugins. They are folded into the VOLA plugin.

20051012: Revised the CUS gui/storage format. This breaks all the CUS formulas that use the old format.
          Need to update CUS docs for full details.

20051012: Removed the i18n/qtstalker_pl.qm file from CVS. Configure now generates this file.

20051012: Removed the COMP, COUNTER, MATH, REF plugins and folded them into the UTIL plugin. The switch
          to the new CUS format allows us to do this.

20051012: Removed the lib/FormulaInput.* files from CVS. Now deprecated.

20051012: Fixed bug in STOCH that used BarData for high/low instead of user provided data.

20051012: Had to remove the AND/OR and THEN/ELSE functionality from the COMP plugin. The new CUS format
          makes this very difficult. Instead user will have to replace the removed logic with additional
          steps in their CUS scripts. grrr more CUS breakage will ensue.

20051012: Fixed bug in CUS::getMinBars that did not calculate minBars properly. This was causing the Scanner
          to fail because not enough bars were being loaded.

20051013: Removed the Macro functions. I am not satisfied with them as they appear half-assed.
          They need to be revised at a later time.

20051013: Merged AdaptiveSTOCH plugin into the STOCH plugin.

20051013: Merged ROC plugin into the MOM plugin.

20051013: Merged PER plugin into the UTIL plugin.

20051014: Removed the MAOSC plugin. It duplicates the MACD plugin.

20051014: Merged VT plugin into the VOL plugin.

20051014: Moved the LOWPASS code out of the MA plugin back into it's own LOWPASS plugin. MA code was getting
          messy to wrap easily.

20051022: New indicator plugin BARS. Use this to plot bars/candles in any plot area.

20051024: Removed the chart plugins. Bar and candle are replaced by the BARS indicator plugin. Users can
          create more flexible charts now. I am not sure if I will add Swing/P&F/EP styles to the BARS plugin.
          I will need substantial user complaints to restore them.

          Users will now have to create a BARS indicator and add it to the main plot manually. This way, users
          can put bars/candles on any plot they want.

20051024: Added a COLOR option to the UTIL plugin. Adds ability to change the color of individual bars.
          Use this in CUS scripts to create paint bars/candles etc.

20051026: Merged all the plot types (Main, Stacked, Tabbed) into one tabbed style. Up to 3 rows
          of tabs can now be created. Just choose the row # in which you want the indicator to appear.

20051026: Moved the Log Scaling and Date plot toolbar functions to each individual indicator. The
          indicator popup context menu now contains these toggles.

20051026: Fixed bug #1332975 - chart objects available for deletion.
          
20051028: Moved the crosshairs toggle from the plot context menu to the main toolbar.

20051028: Added a filter box to the indicator page. Works the same as the one in the chart page.

20051031: Added zone lines to the CCI plugin as per request.

20051101: Changed weekly chart dates to use month number to avoid overcrowding.

20051101: Fixed chart info writing over chart bars.

20051102: Applied patch #1345509 install.html - use binary release Qt and DB

20051103: Added new paper trading mode. Toggle the paper trade mode toolbar button. 2 new buttons will appear
          beside the chart slider. The first button allows you to set the date you want to start the paper
          trade. The second button advances the chart by one bar. This allows the user to simulate paper
          trading easily.

20051106: Upgraded FreeBSD compiler directives to use Berkeley DB 4.3.

20051106: Fixed bug in the Tester that did not use trade delay properly. Use the trade delay
          to enter/exit trades on the next trade delay bars.

20051106: Added bar compression option to the tester.

20051107: Added bar compression option to the scanner.

20051108: Removed the bar chart from the tester plot page. Not really useful.

20051110: Applied patch #1353064 - PlotLine copying.

20051115: CME changed the file format. Updated the CME quote plugin.

20051115: Fixed bug in tester that does not exit trade and enter new one within the same bar.
          This also fixes the 2 consecutive TRUE values to trigger an alert bug.

20051115: CUS scripts can now handle comments. You can either dedicate an entire line to a comment
          or you can place a comment at the end of a line. All comments must start with a // 
          the same as C++ comments do. Here is an example:

          // get some candles
          candles := BARS(Candles)
          vol := UTIL(REF, Volume, 0) // get some volume bars

20051117: Changed the tester volume percentage option to default to a volume of 1 if it is set to 0.

20060117: Applied patch 1366297 - percentage profit for each paper. Thanks to imo for the patch.

20060120: Fixed CUS parsing error with input array labels ie. Closen, Opened etc.

20060204: Experimental: Added new indicator TALIB. This uses the TALIB library to create any TALIB
          indicator.

20060205: Added TALIB CUS reference docs.

20060205: Removed TypPrice from the UTIL plugin. 

20060205: Removed the OBV function from the VOL plugin. 

20060205: Removed the SD function from the VOLA plugin.

20060205: Removed the AD, AROON, ATR, BB, CCI, CMO, DMI, DPO, MA, MACD, MF, MINMAX, MOM, RSI
          SAR, STOCH, TRIX, WILLR plugins and docs.

20060205: Added new MA types from TALIB.

20060208: Fixed bug in CUS plugin that did not accept a non-input from BARS plugin.

20060209: Fixed bug in TALIB plugin that did not keep settings when being modified.

20060601: Removed all the macro code. Would like to wait until the main code has stabilised
          before we continue with the macro module. Would also like to put all macro code
          into a single separate module.

20060617: Removed the chart object plugins and merged the code into qtstalkerlib. The amount
          of overhead and code complexity of plugins is not required. I believe it is more effecient
          to use qtstalkerlib instead. 

20060617: Added icons to the chart object popup menu items.

20060620: Fixed bug in Tester that did not calculate account balances properly as trades
          are made. We always ended up with a few 100 more unexplained dollars.

20060621: Cleaned up the Tester code by splitting off code into sub classes.

20060623: Added a toolbar to the chart page on the Tester gui.

20060628: Added a bars parm to the scanner gui. Users will have to set the value manually.

20060628: Added a midpoint option to the entry/exit price in the tester.

20060629: Restored the bar chart to the tester. Instead of buy and sell arrows to indicate
          entry and exit points, we are coloring the bars green for long and red for short.
          I like this better than the arrows.

20060630: Fixed bug in tester that caused stops to delay by an extra bar.

20060630: Added option in the tester that calculates commissions as a percentage of the total
          amount bought. Check the 'Use Commission %' option and input the percentage ie.
          0.02 for 2% or 0.1 for 10% etc.

20060703: Added option in UTIL(REF) indicator function that allows user to create Horizontal lines
          in CUS scripts. ie.  hline := UTIL(REF, 5.5) would create a plot with one value of 5.5.
          Then apply the 'Horizontal' line style option to the hline variable to plot it.

20060704: When creating/editing CUS indicators, the user no longer has to input the variable name
          manually. User can now choose from a list all the available variables.

20060708: Fixed bug in tester that continued to enter trades even when account lacked the
          required amount of funds.

20060713: Added key shortcut (CTRL+Key_Right) to advance chart one bar in paper trade mode.

20060716: Simplified and improved the bar creation functions in DbPlugin for speed and memory.

20060716: Removed the IndicatorPlugin::minBars function. Not practical anymore as we move toward
          TALIB integration.

20060716: Papertrade mode now works with all bar length charts. Previously only worked with daily
          charts.

20060717: Added search filter boxes to the Tester and Scanner panels. They work the same as the
          Indicator and Chart panels do.

20060717: Fixed bug in Scanner that did not clean group directory properly before starting new
          scan with same scanner rule. Was generating link errors.

20060804: Removed the chart type plugins and merged them into DbPlugin class. I do not see these
          to change much over time so we don't need the extra overhead.

20060804: Added option to CC type charts to create gapless/non-gapless charts.
       
20060829: I got tired of looking up the correct format for each indicator when constructing CUS
          indicators. So, I added a format builder dialog to the CUS dialog. This allows the user to
          quickly use the dialog to construct the CUS format for each variable and insert it into the
          editor.

20060829: VIDYA indicator dialog missing input array parm. Fixed.

20060903: Added proper TA_Initialze and TA_Shutdown function calls to the TALIB indicator.

20060905: Added default indicators to new installs and upgrades. Bars, Candles, Volume.
          Add more?

20060908: Fixed: Group panel now refreshes after a scanner is completed.

20060912: Applied patches:

20060912: Changed local indicators function to use directory symlinks instead.

20060912: Expanded and polished the TALIB docs and plugin operations. Missing parms and lists
          now available in the gui dialogs.

20060914: Changed the gui to improve record navigation for editing chart records on disk in the
          Edit Chart dialogs.

20060920: Upgraded TALib source to 0.2.

20060920: Removed indicator UO. TALib now handles this.

20061011: Fixed bug #1468042 - default color not used in plot.

20061011: Applied patch 1569805 - TALib url changes for docs.

20061012: Added macx directive to TALIB.pro to fix TALib build problem on OSX.

20061012: Added default color parm option to the BARS candle script interface.

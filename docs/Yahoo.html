<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Misc. Plugin - Yahoo<br>
</h3>
<br>
This plugin allows the user to download historical and symbol details
data from yahoo financial. Currently there are 2 types of downloads.
'History' downloads historical data and 'Details' downloads info about
each symbol eg. the company name. Currently, 'Details' only covers the
company name, but it is hoped that we will expand this to include all
the possible info available.<br>
<br>
Here is a quick tutorial on how to use it:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Firstly add the yahoo symbols you want by pressing the 'Symbols'
button, then pressing the 'Add' button to enter a list of symbols
separated by a spaces.</li>
  <li>Select the start and end dates of quotes to receive.</li>
  <li>Decide if you want to use the split adjusted values (check it if
you do not enjoy large price gaps in your charts).</li>
  <li>Either check the 'Select All Symbols' or manually select the
symbols from a list to update.</li>
  <li>Press either the History button for quotes, or the Details button
for symbol info.</li>
  <li>Watch the magic ensue :-)</li>
</ol>
<br>
Hopefully everything went well and there were no error messages. The
download status will update for each symbol in the Message Log.<br>

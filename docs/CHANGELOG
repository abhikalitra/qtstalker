0.20
====

- Some compile errors reported because I made some changes that apply to Qt3.1.2 that are not compatible with Qt3.0*
  Back ported the QString::remove to Qt3.0*
  
- I split the ./compile script into 2 scripts. ./compile creates the qtstalker binary, and ./compile_plugins creates all
  the plugins. This is to make the compile process more efficient and flexible.
  
- Thanks to Marco van Zwetselaar for a patch to implement Log scaling to charts. 

- Added a "Color Bars" parm to draw color up and down bars for the VOL plugin. This only works if you use the
  histogram bars line style.
  
- Added a data panel located under the tab area that dynamically updates all the chart values where the mouse is currently located.

- Reports that 0.19 does not create a binary on some dist's "debian". 0.17 compiles fine. I think this is because
  I removed the -ldl linker option for FreeBSD. Some dist's need the linker option. Updated all the *.pro files to add
  the -ldl linker option if on a linux-g++ system.
  
- Added new chart type "Swing". This is the typical Gann swing chart type.

- Experimented with an OSX port. Turns out apple has a broken plugin system, you can load them but can't unload them.
  Until they fix this, a OSX port will not be practical or efficient. Cmon apple, even win32 can do this...think different?
  
- Added the stdlib header to GroupPage to fix a compile error on Debian.


0.19
====

This is a rush release to address some nasty bugs.

- There was a nasty bug that segfaulted on new installs and when trying to delete the last tabbed indicator.
  In trying to fix this I found an annoying limitation with the QTabWidget. In order to fix this I had to make
  a tabbed indicator page always visible in order to propagate resize signals properly.

- Adjusted the initial chart position by one bar due to some plots being partially truncated.

- I was unhappy with the all the tab function buttons causing limitations to resizing. I removed the buttons
  and replaced them with a context menu instead. Just right click with the mouse to bring it up. Doh!

- Changed the tab directory widgets to behave more like the standard directory dialogs. Double clicks to
  enter and leave sub directories instead of single clicks. Singles were creating some problems.

0.18
====

- Removed the -ldl linker parm from all *.pro files. This was a legacy issue, no longer needed.
  Now compiles on FreeBSD just like on Linux. Yea baby.

- Updated CC plugin to allow for rollover control. Number used is days from last trading day to
  rollover to the next contract. This can be a lengthy process to run this plugin as it has to rebuild each chart
  from scratch every time you update. Allow for a few minutes to complete. Also added a maximum years
  parm to limit the size of the chart.

- Updated HLC plugin to follow Donchian rule.

- Removed the charts from the backtesting dialog. This was bloat and fluff we don't need. Everything that is 
  important is in the summary.
  
- Added a global font preference for the app.

- Changed the dialogs to edit most values in place instead of popping up a dialog.

- Made some GUI changes to the toolbar. Replaced chart type and chart compression buttons with combo boxes.

- Changed chart object creation to be alot simpler. After selecting an object to create, just click on the chart and the
  object will be created without user interaction.

- Made a major GUI change by adding a tabbed section on the left of the main screen. This area can be used to expand
  stuff in the future. I merged all the chart, group, portfolio and backtest dialogs onto the tabs. This allows quick and easy
  access to all the major stuff without having to bring up dialogs all the time. To navigate through a group, just use the mouse
  or the keyboard arrow keys to move back and forth.

- Added start and end date controls to the Yahoo plugin for more precise downloads. Hopefully this will solve some of the
  foreign quote problems.
  
- Did some tuning to various classes for better speed and memory usage.

- Added individual pixmaps for each type chart object for better id.

- Updated the docs.

0.17
====

- Bug fix for yahoo quotes that didn't update new symbols first time.

- Added basic indicator documentation.

- Added new quote plugin CC. This creates a continuous adjusted futures chart for each futures symbol available.

- Added status messages to all the quote plugins for monitoring download progress.

- Added an indicator plugin tutorial in the docs.

0.16
======

- added an icon for qtstalker (qtstalker.xpm)

- added font preference for charts

- Fixed bug that didn't update filelist after deleting a chart

- COT changed filenames for the annual file, updated COT quote plugin to handle old and new names.

- Fixed "export" all bug that seg faults when trying to export all charts.

- Added new MA support for Wilder's MA method  and fixed TR function to include first bar. Thanks to Glen for the patch.

- New quote plugin "Ratio". This is a composite that divides two symbols to produce the ratio between them.

- New quote plugin "CSV". This imports comma-separated values (CSV) ascii
  files from the local filesystem.

- Fixed bug that prevented chart objects with a date parm to draw.

- Oh yeah baby, now we are getting serious, the basic backtesting module now completed. First person that finds the best
  indicator rules to short MSFT and UIS stock to oblivion gets drinks on me. Let the games begin.
  
- Added new dialog to edit chart tick data in place.

0.15
======

- Comprehensive documentation now included in the docs directory. Moved all the docs there.
  Whew! I'd rather stare at the wall than write docmentation. It's finally done.
  
- Ported code to Qt3. There is no backwards compatability with =< Qt2.3

- Simplified the plugin interface with a new design. Much simpler now. Plugin is now the base
  class for all plugins. Had to change all the plugins to accomodate the changes.

- Removed chart plugins and merged them back into Plot code, this was not so
  good an idea. Oh well.

- Added new Quote plugins:
    NYBOT - Used to import NYBOT exchange futures data from an ASCII file.
    Qtstalker - Used to import ASCII files that have been exported using qtstalker's export function.
    COT - Download commitment of traders reports for all major futures.
    CMEHistory - Downloads CME history for the current year only.
    Index - Used for creating and updating custom index composites
    Spread - Used for creating and updating custom spread composites

- Removed Variable plugin

- Combined the STOCHF and STOCHS plugin indicators into new STOCH plugin

- Combined the SMA, EMA, WMA plugin indicators into MA plugin

- Added colors to Candle charts

- New indicators:
    MA2 - 2 plot MA
    MA3 - 3 plot MA
    DPO - Detrended Price Oscillator
    VOLR - Volatility Ratio

- added a cancel download function to quotes

- added an install script that installs plugins and files for you instead of doing it manually.

- added colors to text labels on plots.

- added more detail to the date area of charts when zooming in.

- moved chart object and line object management into the plot widget to be more OO

- changed Point & Figure chart to include date spacing

- changed the indicator area back to using tabs, arghh the button text was tool small for toolbar buttons

- Removed NYMEX plugin because they have gone to a dynamic html format along with a click through EULA. Thanks alot NYMEX,
  I guess you dont want to promote the exchange by making quotes easily available.

- Oh boy, I changed db's again... I keep flip flopping, but I did some tests with db-2.7.7 against gdbm-1.8 and managed a
  25% speed increase. So, I replaced gdbm with db. Btree is actually faster than hashing...go figure. Sorry folks, all your existing
  charts are not usable in the old format.

- Recoded ChartDb class to allow for custom data formats, now we can create custom charts for custom quote plugins.

- Putting all the charts in one directory has become a problem when you have several hundred charts. Quote plugins will now create
  sub directories from the root /data. The workwith charts dialog now navigates the directory tree.


0.14
======

This is a bug fix release.

  Chart types, indicators, quote sources, chart objects will be plugins.
  So far, chart types, indicators, quote sources, are now plugins.

- chart objects can be applied to all plots

- plot size now adjustable by using the splitter

- common gui method for changing parameters in dialogs

- redesigned the plot widget to be more OO

- using gdbm for db functions, removed the db dependicies, I am sick and tired of db upgrades
  and version changes

- Comprehensive documentation now included in the docs directory. Moved all the docs there.
  Whew! I'd rather stare at the wall than write docmentation. It's finally done.
  
- Ported code to Qt3. There is no backwards compatability with =< Qt2.3

- Simplified the plugin interface with a new design. Much simpler now. Plugin is now the base
  class for all plugins. Had to change all the plugins to accomodate the changes.

- Removed chart plugins and merged them back into Plot code, this was not so
  good an idea. Oh well.

- Added new Quote plugins:
    NYBOT - Used to import NYBOT exchange futures data from an ASCII file.
    Qtstalker - Used to import ASCII files that have been exported using qtstalker's export function.
    COT - Download commitment of traders reports for all major futures.
    CMEHistory - Downloads CME history for the current year only.
    Index - Used for creating and updating custom index composites
    Spread - Used for creating and updating custom spread composites

- Removed Variable plugin

- Combined the STOCHF and STOCHS plugin indicators into new STOCH plugin

- Combined the SMA, EMA, WMA plugin indicators into MA plugin

- Added colors to Candle charts

- New indicators:
    MA2 - 2 plot MA
    MA3 - 3 plot MA
    DPO - Detrended Price Oscillator
    VOLR - Volatility Ratio

- added a cancel download function to quotes

- added an install script that installs plugins and files for you instead of doing it manually.

- added colors to text labels on plots.

- added more detail to the date area of charts when zooming in.

- moved chart object and line object management into the plot widget to be more OO

- changed Point & Figure chart to include date spacing

- changed the indicator area back to using tabs, arghh the button text was tool small for toolbar buttons

- Removed NYMEX plugin because they have gone to a dynamic html format along with a click through EULA. Thanks alot NYMEX,
  I guess you dont want to promote the exchange by making quotes easily available.

- Oh boy, I changed db's again... I keep flip flopping, but I did some tests with db-2.7.7 against gdbm-1.8 and managed a
  25% speed increase. So, I replaced gdbm with db. Btree is actually faster than hashing...go figure. Sorry folks, all your existing
  charts are not usable in the old format.

- Recoded ChartDb class to allow for custom data formats, now we can create custom charts for custom quote plugins.

- Putting all the charts in one directory has become a problem when you have several hundred charts. Quote plugins will now create
  sub directories from the root /data. The workwith charts dialog now navigates the directory tree.

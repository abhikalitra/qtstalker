<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">LMS - Least Mean Square
Predictor</h3>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span><br>
<br>
This is another indicator from the DSP (Digital Signal
Processing) arena. Ehlers uses a least mean squares technique to
generate a 2 day and a 5 day prediction of a modified slow
stochastic.<br>
<br>
There are two modes: <br>
<br>
Cycle mode where the indicator is plotted as a normal tabbed indicator
and works best when there is rapid price movement and some cyclic
content. Buy signals are generated when the SlowK line crosses over the
2 or 5 day prediction line.<br>
<br>
The Counter Trend mode can be used in the same way but can also be
ploted on the main chart with a low delay filter (e.g. EMA or even
better LowPass) to indicate counter trend trades i.e. the signal to buy
is when the low delay moving average crosses over the 2 or 5 day
prediction.<br>
<br>
More information can be found at www.mesa.co.uk/articles/ in the
article "Linear Prediction". There are more cycle oriented articles
there as well.<br>
<br>
Some notes on the implementation: <br>
<br>
1. Included in the preferences dialog is the abiblty to change both the
fast and slow "K" values. This is not in Ehler's original code. He uses
only one value for slowK and
recommends the value of 10 periods -- the default is set for 5 periods.<br>
<br>
2. Also included is a "test pattern" which is a simple sine wave that
replaces the price data. This pattern will show how well the selected
parameters can track the "ideal" signal
and give some confidence to cyclic doubters :-)<br>
<br>
Actually, item 2 is a confidence check that the code is actually
corrrect! These signals have a tendency to wander in their initial
directions and are rather difficult to trust
without some confirmation -- in trading or coding....<br>

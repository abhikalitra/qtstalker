<h2><u>Back Tester Rules</u></h2>
   The rules page allows you to assign one or more indicators to each of
the  four trade actions. The four trade actions are:   
<ul>
     <li>Enter Long - Enter a long trade if all indicators listed issue a 
buy  signal. A long position will only be entered if the rule is out or short.</li>
     <li>Exit Long - Exit a long trade if all indicators listed issue a sell 
 signal.</li>
     <li>Enter Short - Enter a short trade if all indicators listed issue 
a  sell signal. A short position will only be entered if the rule is out or
long.</li>
     <li>Exit Short - Exit a short trade if all indicators listed issue a 
buy  signal</li>
     
</ul>
  You may use more than one indicator for each trading rule. In order for 
a trade action to be triggered, each of the indicators listed must be true.
 So, if you apply 2 indicators to the Enter Long action, both of the indicators
 must have issued a "buy signal" for the action to take effect.<br>

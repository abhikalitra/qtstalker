<h2><u>Scanner Panel<br>

</u></h2>

<p>The scanner tab allows you scan symbols using a user defined
formula. All the symbols that meet the criteria of the scan are put
into chart group. The chart group will use the same name as the scan
name, and be located as a folder under the "Scanner" group.</p>

<h4>New Scanner</h4>

Here you can create a new scanner. Selecting this will bring up a
series of dialogs. First you are asked for a name to call your new
scanner. The name must be unique, if not an error message will
display. After that, the scanner dialog will appear.<br>

<br>

<h4>Open Scanner</h4>

This will load and display the selected scanner in the scanner
dialog.
<h4>Delete Scanner</h4>

Deletes the selected scanner.<br>

<h4>Rename Scanner<br>

</h4>

<p>This brings up a dialog that allows you to enter the new name of the
selected scanner.</p>

<h4>Run Scanner</h4>

Allows the user to select a list scanners to run in sequence.<br>

<br>

<br>

<h2>Scanner Dialog</h2>

<br>

The "Scan" button will perform the scan. The "Apply" button will save
the scan rule.<br>

<br>
Symbol Selection: Checking the "All symbols" box will choose all
symbols in the qtstalker database for scanning. Pressing the symbols
button will bring up a file selector dialog that allows you to select
the symbols of your desire. Use the Chart/Group selector to choose either
charts or groups.<br>

<br>

Bar Length: the bar length to
use when scanning symbols.<br>

<br>

Bars: The amount of bars to load for each symbol. Make sure you choose
a number that will accomodate the bars required for the scanner
formula. ie. a 200 MA will need at least 200 bars.<br>

<br>

Scanner Formula: This is where the user must enter a CUS type of
formula to use for the scanning logic. See the CUS indicator plugin for
details on how to construct a formula.<br>

<br>

Once all the parameters are entered, the user presses the Scan button
to perform the scan. A progress dialog will then display the progress
of the scan. The scan can be aborted by pressing the Cancel button from
the progress dialog.<br>

<br>

**CRITICAL**<br>

In order for any scanner formula to work, you must have a boolean array
variable plotted in order to generate the scan logic. The plotted
variable is the one that qtstalker uses for selecting symbols. A FALSE
value will ignore the symbol and a TRUE value will select the symbol.<br>

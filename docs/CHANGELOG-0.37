20090911: Made a little more space between plots and widget edges.

20090912: Removed Cycle chart object. This is better suited as an indicator.

	  Removed adjustForSplit() functions from chart objects. These are better suited for DataBase::

20090914: Folded all chart object classes into IndicatorPlot:: to remove the legacy plugin structure,
	  simplify and improve efficiency.

	  Removed BuyArrow, FiboLine, HorizontalLine, SellArrow, Text, TrendLine, VerticalLine COBase classes.

	  Added new CODialog class. This is the gui dialog to edit chart objects.

	  Applied patch (#2857550 - chars replacement in csv and progress indicator). Thanks to Austin (x_curve)
	  for the patch.
	  
	  Chart objects now display some values in the data panel when selected.

	  Fixed bug that segfaults when new indicator is added with no chart loaded.

	  Fixed bug that added an empty item in the recent charts list in the main toolbar.

20090920: Fixed bars to load editing bug.

          Recent charts list now updates when item is selected.

20090922: Changed DataBase chart functions to use a user editable SQL commands. The SQL commands are
	  found in the SQL page of the preferences dialog.

	  Added a SQL page to the preferences dialog to allow users to edit the chart commands to the DB.
	  This allows users to modify the SQL commands for user defined db's. NOTE: Do not change any
	  sub strings marked with a dollar sign eg. $symbol, $sd, $ed. These are place holders that
	  qtstalker will later replace with valid values on the fly.

	  Removed the table field and index table parms from the Quotes page.

	  Renamed the preferences dialog Quotes page to 'DB'.

20090924: Added rubberband method of selecting a chart area to zoom. Crosshairs and drawing mode must be off.
          Left double click, hold and drag the cursor to size the rubberband to select an area. Release the mouse
          button to complete the zoom. The chart will then move and zoom the area to fill the complete space
          available. The zoom in and zoom out toolbar buttons will update. To restore the chart, user may either
          press the zoom out button or press either bar spacing buttons to reset. Zooms are unlimited
          for each symbol. Once a new symbol is loaded, the zooms are cleared.

          Removed the bar spacing spinbox and the third bar spacing button.

          Added tooltips to the preferences dialog. Removed a few settings that may cause gui conflicts.

20091001: Changed the default sql statements for Setup class. CVS users will need to refresh their ~/.qtstalker/data.sqlite*
          files with either a new one or manually edit the preferences dialog sql page parms. You will need to look at
          the defaults in Setup class to see what the new values are. I changed the Config::DbFirstDate, Config::DbLastDate and
          Config::DbGetSymbol settings.

20091004: Worked on bar date bug. Database date does not match date displayed by the bar. Not sure if it is fixed. Need some
          testers to confirm.

20091005: Added time field to the CSV app.

20091008: Added new class to the CSV app to handle settings called Database::. Cleaned up sql code.

20091009: Added a refresh chart toggle button to the toolbar. If toggled, this will refresh the chart every x minutes.
          Useful if bars are being updated quickly in quote database. The minutes are selected in the preferences dialog.

20091012: Removed unused pics from pics/.

	  Added a Enum parm interface to Indicator:: class to simplify code.

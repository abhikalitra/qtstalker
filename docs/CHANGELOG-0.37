20080708: Improved parsing of comma-separated values for CSV and Yahoo plugins. If there is a "Name" field, then it can now contain commas. Applied patch #2010375. Thanks to blshkv.

20090909: Completed qt4 port.
	  Removed Scanner and Backtesting functions. Perhaps redo in future.
	  Ported db functions to use sqlite for local db functions.
	  Quotes now managed by the user. Using qt4 sql functions to access quotes.
	  Indicators are now fully scripted using any compatible scripting language. See ExScript class.
	  Code overhaul and clean up performed. Many minor changes. Code simplification completed.

20090910: Added ability to add items to groups from group page.

20090911: Made a little more space between plots and widget edges.

20090912: Removed Cycle chart object. This is better suited as an indicator.

	  Removed adjustForSplit() functions from chart objects. These are better suited for DataBase::

20090914: Folded all chart object classes into IndicatorPlot:: to remove the legacy plugin structure,
	  simplify and improve efficiency.

	  Removed BuyArrow, FiboLine, HorizontalLine, SellArrow, Text, TrendLine, VerticalLine COBase classes.

	  Added new CODialog class. This is the gui dialog to edit chart objects.

	  Applied patch (#2857550 - chars replacement in csv and progress indicator). Thanks to Austin (x_curve)
	  for the patch.

	  Chart objects now display some values in the data panel when selected.

20090915: TODO done. When mouse cursor passes over a chart object, parms are displayed in the data panel.

	  ChartPage now saves last used symbol search and attempts to load that search on startup.

	  Fixed bug that segfaults when new indicator is added with no chart loaded.

	  Added new buy/sell lines to RSI and STOCH scripts.

	  Removed FileButton class. Not used anymore.

	  Added Config::IndicatorScriptDefault to the new indicator dialog. Got tired of typing in the long
	  script path.

	  Added SYMBOL fuction to ExScript class. Creates an array of close values of the given symbol (ticker).

20090917: Fixed Config to load defaults if none found.

	  Preferences dialog saves window size properly now.

	  Fixed bug that did not update chart panel properly after preferences dialog has closed.

	  Applied patch (day + 3ma script - ID: 2860785). Thanks to Austin (x_curve) for the patch.

20090918: Fixed bar building function. Loads very quickly now.

	  Fixed bug that added an empty item in the recent charts list in the main toolbar.

20090920: Fixed bars to load editing bug.

          Recent charts list now updates when item is selected.

20090922: Changed DataBase chart functions to use a user editable SQL commands. The SQL commands are
	  found in the SQL page of the preferences dialog.

	  Added a SQL page to the preferences dialog to allow users to edit the chart commands to the DB.
	  This allows users to modify the SQL commands for user defined db's. NOTE: Do not change any
	  sub strings marked with a dollar sign eg. $symbol, $sd, $ed. These are place holders that
	  qtstalker will later replace with valid values on the fly.

	  Removed the table field and index table parms from the Quotes page.

	  Renamed the preferences dialog Quotes page to 'DB'.

20090924: Added rubberband method of selecting a chart area to zoom. Crosshairs and drawing mode must be off.
          Left double click, hold and drag the cursor to size the rubberband to select an area. Release the mouse
          button to complete the zoom. The chart will then move and zoom the area to fill the complete space
          available. The zoom in and zoom out toolbar buttons will update. To restore the chart, user may either
          press the zoom out button or press either bar spacing buttons to reset. Zooms are unlimited
          for each symbol. Once a new symbol is loaded, the zooms are cleared.

          Removed the bar spacing spinbox and the third bar spacing button.

          Added tooltips to the preferences dialog. Removed a few settings that may cause gui conflicts.

20091001: Changed the default sql statements for Setup class. CVS users will need to refresh their ~/.qtstalker/data.sqlite*
          files with either a new one or manually edit the preferences dialog sql page parms. You will need to look at
          the defaults in Setup class to see what the new values are. I changed the Config::DbFirstDate, Config::DbLastDate and
          Config::DbGetSymbol settings.

20091004: Worked on bar date bug. Database date does not match date displayed by the bar. Not sure if it is fixed. Need some
          testers to confirm.

20091005: Added time field to the CSV app.

20091008: Added new class to the CSV app to handle settings called Database::. Cleaned up sql code.

20091009: Added a refresh chart toggle button to the toolbar. If toggled, this will refresh the chart every x minutes.
          Useful if bars are being updated quickly in quote database. The minutes are selected in the preferences dialog.

20091012: Removed unused pics from pics/.

	  Added a Enum parm interface to Indicator:: class to simplify code.

20091022: Added IndicatorSettings:: class. Added indicatorSettings table to db. This stores a description and settings format
          for every indicator. Used by ExScript to simplify code and speed up format parsing. This will also be used to
          allow a gui for indicator building in the future.

20091023: Added IndicatorDialog:: class. This is a dialog for editing the indicator options.

          Changed the format of the way an indicator script is run slightly. The command and script file portions of the
          script command have been split into 2 parameters. The command parm is now just the script interpreter desired
          along with any command line switches eg. 'perl -i blah'  The second parm is the script file path
          eg. '/usr/local/share/qtstalker/indicators/Volume.perl'  NOTE: You will have to start a new ./qtstalker/data.sqlite*
          file due to SQL table changes.

20091025: Added new class IndicatorScript:: This handles the logic of the scripting of indicators. Was split off of ExScript
          for better efficiency. Preparing ExScript to be the scripting engine for future features.

          Made a change to the indicator scripting format. In order for consistancy and future expansion, I added the
          INDICATOR key word in front of all parms in a script. eg. 'SMA,sma,Close,14' has become 'INDICATOR,SMA,sma,Close,14'
          All CUS_examples have been modified. CVS users please update any of your personal indicators to reflect this change.

20091129: Charts added to the recent charts combobox are now placed at the top of the list.

          Fixed CSV bug when importing files with multiple symbols. The filename was being used.

          Docs are mostly updated now. Need some minor changes here and there. No biggie.

          Now able to delete multiple charts from the group tab instead of one at a time.

20091210: When double clicking the mouse on a chart, the cursor changes to notify user that a rubberband
          selection is taking place.

          Recent charts list now always orders charts starting from most recent to last displayed. The maximum
          number of charts in the list is 10. Maybe will add a perferences option to change the maximum number
          in future.

          Fixed preferences dialog bug with fonts not being displayed correctly.

          Added docs/api/.cvsignore file to ignore changes to the index.qhp file.

20100118: Added a button to the toolbar that runs a Qtstalker script. Will probably expand this
          to maybe a new script manager tab in the future. For now, we will just use the button.
          This function is not meant for indicator scripts, but for the expanding scripting
          facility that will eventually be able to script most qtstalker functions. You can run
          an indicator script if you want, but nothing will happen. We will see if we can integrate
          the two in the future to a single script queue.

          Modified the SYMBOL indicator function to better handle scripts. Format has changed. See
          the docs.

          Added a new SYMBOL_LIST function to the script interface. See the docs.

20100119: Changed the GET_INDICATOR script function. Added the BARS parm. This allows user to specify
          how many BARS they want returned. See docs for details.

20100121: In order to enable a simple scripting system, I felt it was better to break down the big classes
          into many simple classes. Wrote wrapper classes for every indicator. This way we can allow for
          flexibility and keep a single interface. Will be doing more of the same where possible.
          Added 50+ new classes, mostly ta-lib wrappers.

20100122: Added FI, LMS, PP, SZ, THERM, VFI, VIDYA indicators from 0.36.

20100130: Big changes to the indicators. I have reinstated the 0.36 version of indicators. Now we can have
          the old hard coded version that uses a GUI for settings and the script version. Use the CUS
          indicator to use scripts. Will be tweaking the indicators over time. Possibly adding MA
          capability for them.

          Consolidated many indicators into grouped functions like CDL, TRIG, MATH, MATH2 etc. See docs.

          Removed most of the /misc/CUS_examples that did not demonstrate good uses of indicator scripts.

20100131: Fixed a bug in CSV that did not prepare the filename to be used as a symbol override. Also
          fixed bug that did not use the supplied symbol switch if no symbol was specified in the csv field
          format switch. Also added a 'G' format field option to ignore unused fields in the data stream.
          Also, when using the filename as a symbol, no attempt to strip off the suffix will be made. This
          may interfere with user plans to actually use the suffix. Better not second guess the users.
          Anyway, file suffix's are an evil dos, win32 legacy conventions and should be severely
          punished by law. Updated docs to reflect the changes.

          Fixed bug that did not update charts that are newly created in Qtstalker::

20100206: I have re-implemented the 0.36 version of the hard coded indicators along side the new
          scripting engine so we can have the best of both worlds. The script interface will be
          changing slightly for some of the indicators as I tweak each indicator. I will try to
          keep the docs current to reflect those changes as I make them. I am happy with the new
          changes and think we have (FINALLY!) a way to keep everyone (noobs and pros) satisfied.
          GUI and script versions YAY!!!!! I removed most the example scripts and kept the ones
          that provided good examples of how to do things.

          Added 4 new script commands. INDICATOR_GET_INDEX, CLEAR, GROUP_ADD, GROUP_DELETE.
          See docs. With these new commands, it is now possible to run scans. I am thinking
          of creating a seperate scan app so as not to bog down qtstalker with bloat and
          performance bottlenecks. Although an entire database scan did not use more than 25%
          CPU on my mid powered system while happily viewing charts. Could be possible to
          integrate scripting easily with adequate performance.

          Changed the GET_INDICATOR command to INDICATOR_GET and SET_INDICATOR to INDICATOR_SET. This
          is to better organize the commands into common groups. Docs and scripts are updated.

20100207: Added GROUP_GET, INDICATOR_GET_SIZE script commands. See docs.

          Fixed ExScript bug that caused a script to hang when parsing incorrect syntax.

20100208: Decoupled the config settings from main database. This allows the user to run multiple
          instances of qtstalker while allowing each instance to share all the common data such
          as indicators, groups etc. Changes made in one instance will be reflected in all other
          instances except for the preferences which are unique to each instance. Use the -session
          command line option to generate each instance.

          Added script side panel for script management. Works much the same as the other panels.

20100213: Applied patch ID 2951227 - (fix ATR parameter checking. Add SYMBOL_GET for ExScript).
          Thanks to John Anderson for the patch.

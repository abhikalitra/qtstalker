20080503: Added docs/db.html "Database explanation and alternative data loading methods", i.e. direct access to the Berkeley DB files. Thanks to xley.

20080505: Bar length buttons and combobox were not synchronized. Applied patch #1957299. Thanks to rgf.

20080505: Add Preferences options to show buttons for 60-minute and 5-minute bar length. Applied patch #1908413. Thanks to rgf.

20080529: Chart object "FiboLine" now shows all line values as they are being added. Applied patch #1965845. Thanks to blshkv.

20080708: Improved parsing of comma-separated values for CSV and Yahoo plugins. If there is a "Name" field, then it can now contain commas. Applied patch #2010375. Thanks to blshkv.

20090909: Completed qt4 port.
	  Removed Scanner and Backtesting functions. Perhaps redo in future.
	  Ported db functions to use sqlite for local db functions.
	  Quotes now managed by the user. Using qt4 sql functions to access quotes.
	  Indicators are now fully scripted using any compatible scripting language. See ExScript class.
	  Code overhaul and clean up performed. Many minor changes. Code simplification completed.

20090910: Added ability to add items to groups from group page.

20090911: Made a little more space between plots and widget edges.

20090912: Removed Cycle chart object. This is better suited as an indicator.

	  Removed adjustForSplit() functions from chart objects. These are better suited for DataBase::

20090914: Folded all chart object classes into IndicatorPlot:: to remove the legacy plugin structure,
	  simplify and improve efficiency.

	  Removed BuyArrow, FiboLine, HorizontalLine, SellArrow, Text, TrendLine, VerticalLine COBase classes.

	  Added new CODialog class. This is the gui dialog to edit chart objects.

	  Applied patch (#2857550 - chars replacement in csv and progress indicator). Thanks to Austin (x_curve)
	  for the patch.

	  Chart objects now display some values in the data panel when selected.

20090915: TODO done. When mouse cursor passes over a chart object, parms are displayed in the data panel.

	  ChartPage now saves last used symbol search and attempts to load that search on startup.

	  Fixed bug that segfaults when new indicator is added with no chart loaded.

	  Added new buy/sell lines to RSI and STOCH scripts.

	  Removed FileButton class. Not used anymore.

	  Added Config::IndicatorScriptDefault to the new indicator dialog. Got tired of typing in the long
	  script path.

	  Added SYMBOL fuction to ExScript class. Creates an array of close values of the given symbol (ticker).

20090917: Fixed Config to load defaults if none found.

	  Preferences dialog saves window size properly now.

	  Fixed bug that did not update chart panel properly after preferences dialog has closed.

	  Applied patch (day + 3ma script - ID: 2860785). Thanks to Austin (x_curve) for the patch.

20090918: Fixed bar building function. Loads very quickly now.

	  Fixed bug that added an empty item in the recent charts list in the main toolbar.

20090920: Fixed bars to load editing bug.

          Recent charts list now updates when item is selected.

20090922: Changed DataBase chart functions to use a user editable SQL commands. The SQL commands are
	  found in the SQL page of the preferences dialog.

	  Added a SQL page to the preferences dialog to allow users to edit the chart commands to the DB.
	  This allows users to modify the SQL commands for user defined db's. NOTE: Do not change any
	  sub strings marked with a dollar sign eg. $symbol, $sd, $ed. These are place holders that
	  qtstalker will later replace with valid values on the fly.

	  Removed the table field and index table parms from the Quotes page.

	  Renamed the preferences dialog Quotes page to 'DB'.

20090924: Added rubberband method of selecting a chart area to zoom. Crosshairs and drawing mode must be off.
          Left double click, hold and drag the cursor to size the rubberband to select an area. Release the mouse
          button to complete the zoom. The chart will then move and zoom the area to fill the complete space
          available. The zoom in and zoom out toolbar buttons will update. To restore the chart, user may either
          press the zoom out button or press either bar spacing buttons to reset. Zooms are unlimited
          for each symbol. Once a new symbol is loaded, the zooms are cleared.

          Removed the bar spacing spinbox and the third bar spacing button.

          Added tooltips to the preferences dialog. Removed a few settings that may cause gui conflicts.

20091001: Changed the default sql statements for Setup class. CVS users will need to refresh their ~/.qtstalker/data.sqlite*
          files with either a new one or manually edit the preferences dialog sql page parms. You will need to look at
          the defaults in Setup class to see what the new values are. I changed the Config::DbFirstDate, Config::DbLastDate and
          Config::DbGetSymbol settings.

20091004: Worked on bar date bug. Database date does not match date displayed by the bar. Not sure if it is fixed. Need some
          testers to confirm.

20091005: Added time field to the CSV app.

20091008: Added new class to the CSV app to handle settings called Database::. Cleaned up sql code.

20091009: Added a refresh chart toggle button to the toolbar. If toggled, this will refresh the chart every x minutes.
          Useful if bars are being updated quickly in quote database. The minutes are selected in the preferences dialog.

20091012: Removed unused pics from pics/.

	  Added a Enum parm interface to Indicator:: class to simplify code.

20091022: Added IndicatorSettings:: class. Added indicatorSettings table to db. This stores a description and settings format
          for every indicator. Used by ExScript to simplify code and speed up format parsing. This will also be used to
          allow a gui for indicator building in the future.

20091023: Added IndicatorDialog:: class. This is a dialog for editing the indicator options.

          Changed the format of the way an indicator script is run slightly. The command and script file portions of the
          script command have been split into 2 parameters. The command parm is now just the script interpreter desired
          along with any command line switches eg. 'perl -i blah'  The second parm is the script file path
          eg. '/usr/local/share/qtstalker/indicators/Volume.perl'  NOTE: You will have to start a new ./qtstalker/data.sqlite*
          file due to SQL table changes.

20091025: Added new class IndicatorScript:: This handles the logic of the scripting of indicators. Was split off of ExScript
          for better efficiency. Preparing ExScript to be the scripting engine for future features.

          Made a change to the indicator scripting format. In order for consistancy and future expansion, I added the
          INDICATOR key word in front of all parms in a script. eg. 'SMA,sma,Close,14' has become 'INDICATOR,SMA,sma,Close,14'
          All CUS_examples have been modified. CVS users please update any of your personal indicators to reflect this change.

20091129: Charts added to the recent charts combobox are now placed at the top of the list.

          Fixed CSV bug when importing files with multiple symbols. The filename was being used.

          Docs are mostly updated now. Need some minor changes here and there. No biggie.

          Now able to delete multiple charts from the group tab instead of one at a time.

20091210: When double clicking the mouse on a chart, the cursor changes to notify user that a rubberband
          selection is taking place.

          Recent charts list now always orders charts starting from most recent to last displayed. The maximum
          number of charts in the list is 10. Maybe will add a perferences option to change the maximum number
          in future.

          Fixed preferences dialog bug with fonts not being displayed correctly.

          Added docs/api/.cvsignore file to ignore changes to the index.qhp file.

20100118: Added a button to the toolbar that runs a Qtstalker script. Will probably expand this
          to maybe a new script manager tab in the future. For now, we will just use the button.
          This function is not meant for indicator scripts, but for the expanding scripting
          facility that will eventually be able to script most qtstalker functions. You can run
          an indicator script if you want, but nothing will happen. We will see if we can integrate
          the two in the future to a single script queue.

          Modified the SYMBOL indicator function to better handle scripts. Format has changed. See
          the docs.

          Added a new SYMBOL_LIST function to the script interface. See the docs.

20100119: Changed the GET_INDICATOR script function. Added the BARS parm. This allows user to specify
          how many BARS they want returned. See docs for details.

20100121: In order to enable a simple scripting system, I felt it was better to break down the big classes
          into many simple classes. Wrote wrapper classes for every indicator. This way we can allow for
          flexibility and keep a single interface. Will be doing more of the same where possible.
          Added 50+ new classes, mostly ta-lib wrappers.

20100122: Added FI, LMS, PP, SZ, THERM, VFI, VIDYA indicators from 0.36.

20100130: Big changes to the indicators. I have reinstated the 0.36 version of indicators. Now we can have
          the old hard coded version that uses a GUI for settings and the script version. Use the CUS
          indicator to use scripts. Will be tweaking the indicators over time. Possibly adding MA
          capability for them.

          Consolidated many indicators into grouped functions like CDL, TRIG, MATH, MATH2 etc. See docs.

          Removed most of the /misc/CUS_examples that did not demonstrate good uses of indicator scripts.

20100131: Fixed a bug in CSV that did not prepare the filename to be used as a symbol override. Also
          fixed bug that did not use the supplied symbol switch if no symbol was specified in the csv field
          format switch. Also added a 'G' format field option to ignore unused fields in the data stream.
          Also, when using the filename as a symbol, no attempt to strip off the suffix will be made. This
          may interfere with user plans to actually use the suffix. Better not second guess the users.
          Anyway, file suffix's are an evil dos, win32 legacy conventions and should be severely
          punished by law. Updated docs to reflect the changes.

          Fixed bug that did not update charts that are newly created in Qtstalker::

20100206: I have re-implemented the 0.36 version of the hard coded indicators along side the new
          scripting engine so we can have the best of both worlds. The script interface will be
          changing slightly for some of the indicators as I tweak each indicator. I will try to
          keep the docs current to reflect those changes as I make them. I am happy with the new
          changes and think we have (FINALLY!) a way to keep everyone (noobs and pros) satisfied.
          GUI and script versions YAY!!!!! I removed most the example scripts and kept the ones
          that provided good examples of how to do things.

          Added 4 new script commands. INDICATOR_GET_INDEX, CLEAR, GROUP_ADD, GROUP_DELETE.
          See docs. With these new commands, it is now possible to run scans. I am thinking
          of creating a seperate scan app so as not to bog down qtstalker with bloat and
          performance bottlenecks. Although an entire database scan did not use more than 25%
          CPU on my mid powered system while happily viewing charts. Could be possible to
          integrate scripting easily with adequate performance.

          Changed the GET_INDICATOR command to INDICATOR_GET and SET_INDICATOR to INDICATOR_SET. This
          is to better organize the commands into common groups. Docs and scripts are updated.

20100207: Added GROUP_GET, INDICATOR_GET_SIZE script commands. See docs.

          Fixed ExScript bug that caused a script to hang when parsing incorrect syntax.

20100208: Decoupled the config settings from main database. This allows the user to run multiple
          instances of qtstalker while allowing each instance to share all the common data such
          as indicators, groups etc. Changes made in one instance will be reflected in all other
          instances except for the preferences which are unique to each instance. Use the -session
          command line option to generate each instance.

          Added script side panel for script management. Works much the same as the other panels.

20100213: Applied patch ID 2951227 - (fix ATR parameter checking. Add SYMBOL_GET for ExScript).
          Thanks to John Anderson for the patch.

          Split off functions in DataBase:: that deal with quotes into seperate class QuoteDataBase.

          Started adding the back testing app into CVS. Please do not use yet, this is still alpha
          quality and merely in CVS now so I don't have to keep multiple CVS code bases.

          Fixed bug in BARS that did not turn off MA's when used in hard coded indicators. eg BBANDS.

          ******WARNING***************************************************************************
          In order to fix certain issues with the CSV app, I have restructured the CSV quotes database.
          Unfortunately, these changes have created complications for using an external database.
          For now, I have removed the external compatibility code and defaulted to the sqlite
          local version. In order for me to get this project to a 1.0 solid release, I will have
          to drop all the "nice to have" features until the final infrastructure is in place.

          The bad news is that CVS users will have to reload all their quote data into the new
          structure. The good news is that symbol names can be whatever the user wants. So, we
          can keep the original exchange names. Also, this allows me to move faster to finish
          this project.
          ****************************************************************************************

           Added new switches to the CSV app. see docs.

           Removed the compression drop down list on the toolbar and replaced it with all buttons.
           More efficient now.

20100215:  Removed the 'Draw Mode' button from the toolbar. This was a clunky legacy method for
           chart objects. Now you can create them anytime.

           Added a new cursors section to the toolbar. Folded the crosshairs button into the cursor
           group. Depending on the cursor selected, different functions are available. Hope to expand
           this concept in the future. Perhaps extend it to chart objects.

           Moved the CSV app into its own directory called oddly enough... csv.

20100216:  Applied patch #2951337 (fix trendline when use bar is on). Thanks to John Anderson for the patch.

20100217:  Overhauled the chart objects. Split them off into separate classes...again :-( Code clean up
           and simpler interface.

           Renamed FiboLine chart object to Retracement (which is more accurate).

20100218:  Added new toolbar that groups the cursor controls and chart object creation.

           Added 'N' field format option to CSV app. This allows the symbol name to be imported
           within each line of text in a csv quote file.

20100219:  Added symbol name and bar length information to the window title as in version 0.36.

20100220:  Changed the indicator SQL table format. CVS users will can to either delete the
           ~/.qtstalker/data.sqlite file or drop the indicatorIndex table in the file. Then
           recreate the indicators.

20100222:  Restored OHLC bar values to the data window and data panel as in version 0.36

20100227:  Plugins...plugins...plugins...they are back. Long story short, I have been contracted
           to hurry up and finish this project and to convert qtstalker to full use of plugins
           where possible. For now, I have converted the indicators, chart objects and line types
           to plugins. The bulk is complete. I will have to split up some of the indicators that
           have multiple methods to keep code and interface clean and consistant.
           This will entail some script interface changes to some of the indicators.

           NOTE: Lots of changes to the local database, so it would be best to remove the
           ~/.qtstalker/config.sqlite* and ~/.qtstalker/data.sqlite files before installing the
           current CVS.

20100301:  Added expansion fields to the local database to enable future growth. CVS users will
           need to delete their ~/.qtstalker/data.sqlite file before installing. Hopefully this will
           be the last time for a while :-)

20100309:  Big Changes. Removed the CSV app. I have added a script interface to replace the CSV app.
           This was done so we could keep a single scriptable interface. Having CSV app and
           scripting is twice the work. The script interface will also be MUCH more flexible.

           Quote database changes. The quote database will be more centralized so we can better
           manage a proposed plugin interface for quotes. More on this later. The biggest change
           is a restructure that requires a symbol and its exchange listing to be provided for
           all quote queries. This is to allow multiple listings of the same symbol and the
           occassional duplicate symbol name among the world exchanges. The quotes.sqlite database
           has been moved to the ~/.qtstalker directory. I would advise CVS users to avoid using
           these lastest changes yet as I am still fine tuning the database structure as my testing
           continues.

20100310:  Group sql tables have changed, so any groups will have to be recreated.

           PLOT script function has changed. Removed the color field parameter in order to accomodate
           the ability to color line segments. CUS_examples have been updated.

           COLOR script function has changed. A methods parameter has been added. There are 2 methods.
           The 'All' method will change all bars to the same color. The 'Compare' method operates the
           same as the previous version. CUS_examples have been updated.

           CVS users, update your personal indicator scripts to reflect the above changes.

           CUS indicator now has 2 parms. The script command is now split into 2 parts. A command
           parm and the script file. Use the command parm to set the interpreter and any command
           line switches desired. CUS indicators can be reset from qtstalker by editing the indicator
           from the indicator panel.

20100311:  Added new cursor zoom toolbar button. This helps create a class of cursor behaviours that
           are selectable from the toolbar.

20100314:  Added some nice plot markers to the scale section of plots.

20100317:  Changed the script format for QUOTE command. See docs.

20100320:  Moved the plot and object plugins back into qtstalkerlib in order to best work with
           upcoming improvements.

           As per user (lvgandhi) request, I have reinstated the sorting of DTOHLCVI data appearing
           in the info panel. Also added a "Show All Symbols" button in the chart panel.

20100321:  Added an active script list to the script panel. Scripts can now be run on a timer that will
           repeat every X seconds. Also, you are able to run as many scripts simultaneously as desired.
           
20100323:  Chart objects now appear in all bar lengths. Before, they were locked to the original bar length
           and would not plot on charts of differing bar lengths.

20100324:  As per user (lvgandhi) request, the Chart and Group panel lists are sorted.

           Syntax for most script functions has changed in order to keep a common format and
           future expansion. See docs.

20100325:  Added feature. If cursor is in select mode, a double mouse click will center the chart
           on the mouse position.

20100326:  Quote script functions have changed. See docs. These changes allow one quote at a time to be
           collected into a group, then can be saved in a batch using the "SAVE_QUOTES" command.
           Each quote can be a different symbol if desired. This gives a HUGE speed increase saving
           all quotes in one go rather than one at a time.

20100327:  Fixed bug ID: 2977532 (Retracement lines bug).

           SYMBOLS script commands changed to return exchange/symbol pairs. See docs.

20100328:  Changed chartObjects table in ~/.qtstalker/data.sqlite. Delete table and redo your
           chart objects.

           Added new script commands DELETE and GET_QUOTES for the QUOTE command set. See docs.
           I see that some of you 'bleeding-edgers' are making some scripts to manipulate the database.
           Thats's great. However, the quote database is cross linked with other tables and so needs
           to be properly handled rather than just removing the symbolIndex record. So I have created
           a DELETE function to properly clean up and remove all the cross links. If there are any
           script commands you would like to see added, please post your suggestions on the forum.

           Removed SYMBOL indicator plugin and replaced with script commands GET_QUOTES. See docs.

20100407:  Opened up a small area that was previously unused in the bottom right corner of charts. Right now
           it is blank, but I am thinking about using it for a few buttons or drop down items in the future.
           Suggestions are welcomed.

           Fixed a bug in bar creation that reported incorrect datetime.

           Fixed bug when changing bar lengths or symbols, cursor status was not maintained.

20100408:  Moved some duplicated code out of MATH1 and into MA and BARS plugins.

           Moved the slider control from the status bar and added a new slider/button control area to the panel area.
           I feel this is a good position. A little more efficient, closer to most of the mouse actions and right side
           of the chart area. Not too crazy about the icons for the buttons. Will update them to better ones during the
           'polishing phase' of the release.

20100409:  Attempting to organize all the GUI classes into /src from /lib.

           Moved the side toolbar, zoom control, bar length buttons and refresh functions out of QtstalkerApp
           into new GUI classes.

20100410:  Fixed the recent charts toolbar and moved the code into /src/RecentCharts class.

           The exchange names have been changed to use the ISO 10383 standard. Users will have to re-import your
           quotes to use the new exchange codes. The good news is that we will not be changing them again, and
           they are all only 4 characters long for much less typing.

20100411:  Added -asset command line option. See docs 'Command Line Interface' section.

           Added a RENAME script command. See docs.

           Changed zoom button behaviour to be more obvious. Hopefully it makes more sense now.

           Changed all script commands to return "ERROR" string if an error occurs. Lets keep everything nice
           and consistant. Please update your personal scripts to reflect these changes.

           Fixed the SYMBOL,CURRENT command which was returning ERROR for all conditions.

20100412:  Expanded the function buttons and menus to the side panels.

           Fixed bug that only read 1 command line switch at a time.

20100510:  Cleaning up Plot code to increase speed. Have been seeing some odd slowdowns when using a
           non-accelerated X11 driver in various linux distributions.

           Changed scale value markers in the plots to a more pleasing shape?

           Scripting interface has some issues still needed to be fixed. Very unstable right now as I work
           on some big changes. Working on a vector based plotting structure. This will simplify and unify
           the scripting and non-scripted interfaces. Instead of one big massive change to everything, I have
           opted to make the changes incrementally so that bugs can be found and fixed faster.

20100514:  Split the generation of source code documentation into a separate shell script.
           To generate or update the documentation, see docs/api/api.html
           (i.e. install Doxygen, do 'build-api-docs.sh' before doing 'configure'). Thanks to xley.

20100516:  The plots are now positioned and calculated as vectors. What this means is that plots are mapped to
           screen coordinates. They can be shifted left or right past the edge of the chart into the future
           or past as desired. This however is a big change in the way scripts manipulate the data. Scripts
           will now have to handle individual bars rather than entire lists of bars. We have much greater
           flexibilty now on how the data is managed.

           ************************************************************************************************
           WARNING: This means any indicator scripts need to be revised. I would wait until I mention that
           tweaking is completed, otherwise you will need additional revising at a later time. Save yourself
           the hassle and wait until it is completed.
           ************************************************************************************************           

           Made changes to all the script formats for indicators. Each indicator now has a PLOT TYPE and COLOR
           parameters. This is due to the PLOT command changes. See docs for details.

           New INDICATOR command script functions. See docs. Reduced command set to manipulate individual index
           positions rather than sending or receiving long strings of indicator values.

20100516:  Add docs/install-macx.html for Mac OS X. Thanks to xley.

20100517:  Updated docs on latest changes. Removed COLOR, REF, COMPARE, ADD, DIV, MULT, SUB classes. These functions
           have been replaced or can be done from within scripts with native script commands.

           Removed the LMS indicator. As I cannot locate any documentation to how this works, so it cannot be
           ported as yet.

           NOTE: still working on updating the included scripts to the new formats.

20100518:  Removed the scale to screen toolbar button. It is now the default.

           Removed the panel hide toolbar button. Useless bloat.

           Completed CUS_examples script conversions.

20100519:  Fixed bug #3001407 (data value display below 0.01 are zero).

20100525:  Added quick launch script buttons to the script panel. This allows the user to assign scripts to the button
           to run with just one button click. NOTE: only scripts that have been imported into the database
           (the new function) can be assigned to a button. To assign a script to a button, right click on the button
           to display the context menu.

20100526:  Updated some old documentation to now refer to the data-loading via the Script API.
           Enhanced and linked to the Script API overview. Thanks to xley.

20100526:  Added some example data loading and external scripts. Thanks to xley.

20100527:  Internal changes to the indicator plugins to use Indicator:: when passing data.

           Added patch #3007713 (Populate quotes db from Yahoo). This is a nice python script to download and
           install quotes from yahoo. Added to the misc/CUS_examples section. I changed the name to
           getYahooHistQuotes.py. Thanks to wolfch for the patch.

20100529:  Added new INDICATOR command GET_INDEX_DATE. This returns the string date at index position.

           Added script API for all the chart objects. Allows the creation of chart objects to scripted indicators.
           The chart objects are dynamic and are not saved permanantly to the database. This allows for fast, dynamic
           changes to the charts ie. viewing minute bars with rapidly changing patterns. Arrows, support lines and
           retracements to appear only under specific circumstances and price levels.

20100530:  Applied patch #3009102 (Update for patch 3007713). thanks to wolfch for the patch.

           Fixed bug that did not update the toolbar bar spacing buttons when the preferences was changed.

20100601:  Fixed bug that did not toggle the date plot on indicators.

           Chart and group panel lists now enter key selection and single click selection.

           Added refresh list signals for the chart/group panels after a script finishes.

           Fixed bug running an indicator script from the script panel run menu segfaults.

20100602:  Added new plugin panel to the main app. This will be used for user created plugins that do
           whatever they want. The initial plugin will be the return of the CSV plugin to import CSV
           files. Works much like the old app.

20100603:  CSV plugin is ready for testing. i would appreciate user feedback on improvements and
           bugs. thank you.

20100604:  Added a delete symbol menu option to the chart panel.

           Added a DELETE command to the INDICATOR script API command set. See docs.

20100606:  Split the Plot:: cursor functions into separate classes.

           Changed the CSV plugin Date/Time delimiter field from ":" to "=". There was a conflict with the Time
           mask. Be sure to edit your CSV rules to reflect that before testing.

           Moved Plot::setScale to Indicator::

           Merged all the separate MA classes into MAFactory.

20100607:  Fixed csv errors in docs/exchanges.csv file.

           Added a exchange search dialog to the CSV plugin. Use to search for the exchange code.

20100610:  Split off parts of DBPlugin into QuoteIndexDataBase and FuturesParmsDataBase classes.

           Moved the futuresParms and exchangeIndex tables from the quotes.sqlite db into the data.sqlite db.

20100611:  Added new Yahoo plugin. This will download historical quotes from yahoo. Not all exchanges have been
           implemented. Exchanges will be added on a request basis. There is lots of room for improvements so
           suggestions and patches are welcomed.

20100612:  Moved the preferences options for the bar spacing buttons to each button. Right click on the
           toolbar button to bring up the configure menu.

           Same as above for the chart refresh toolbar button.

20100613:  Decentralizing the preferences editing to each gui element. So we can just right click on the gui
           element itself in order to change the settings. The reamining app wide settings will be moved into
           the preferences toolbar button with a small popup context menu for fast changes.

           Removed the menubar. Not needed if we have a toolbar. More room for charts now.

           Added a context menu to the indicator tabs to change the tab position and modify the number of
           tab rows. Right click on any tab to show the menu. We can extend more space for charts if
           the tabs are arranged on the right side.

20100614:  Last viewed indicators are saved and restored properly now.

           Preferences dialog and toolbar button removed. Now all preferences can be edited directly from the
           gui object by either right clicking the mouse on it for a context menu or if only one option is available,
           a dialog will launch.

20100615:  Internal changes. Moved some functions between classes.

           Default chart object preferences were not being set. Fixed.

           Moved Config defaults into proper gui class initializers.

           Connected all main app load/save signals to gui classes. Startup and shutdown of the app
           is noticeably slower. The price to pay for better OO code.

20100617:  Improved thread performance for CSV and Yahoo plugins.

20100618:  More thread performance improvements for CSV and Yahoo plugins.

           Fixed CSV name field import bug.

           Modified bar loading logic for better response time during large amounts of bars.

           Fixed bug in refresh button startup that always started true.

20100619:  Added script interface for details to each security. Will expand this in the future.

           The SET_NAME script option has been merged into the new SET_DETAILS and GET_DETAILS commands. see docs.

20100622:  Removed the toolbar bars spinner and replaced it with a new Date Range Control area. This group of controls
           creates a new way of loading bars using date ranges rather than a specific number of bars. Use the
           Set Date Range button to lock a specific date range for all charts when turned on.

           Internal changes to the Group class to use references instead of pointers.

           Docs updated for QUOTES script command regarding the new date range format.

20100623:  Plot slider buttons now indicate status when slider is moved.

           Fixed 0 bars bug in indicator plugins.

           Misc plugins now refresh the current chart if needed.

           Date range prev/next buttons now indicate list position status.

           Changed db code to be self initializing.

20100628:  Converted indicator calculation to run in a thread to prevent any gui blocking. There might be a little
           noticeable lag when displaying a script inidcator compared to built in ones. This is because each indicator
           calculates and displays individually now rather than in one big batch.

           Changed Scripts to run with a cleaner threading implementation.

20100706:  Added QuoteServer source to the main trunk. Still testing and refining it. Feel free to play with it
           using the sample scripts. I would appreciate comments from those of you that do test it out.


20100720:  Changed the ~/.qtstalker/config* file db structure. You will have to delete your old one before starting
           this latest CVS version.

           Changed the indicatorIndex table structure in the ~/.qtstalker/data.sqlite file.  You will have to delete
           the old table before starting this latest CVS version.

           The groupIndex table schema has changed in ~/.qtstalker/data.sqlite. Drop the table manually
           before starting qtstalker so it will be recreated properly. Old groups will have to be
           manually recreated.

           Added the ability to create multiple columns of charts as well as rows of charts. When you create a new
           indicator, there is a new column field to set. This allows you to create multiple groups of tabbed
           charts in the same row. This works well if you have a nice big monitor and can have several columns of
           charts on several rows. If you have a small screen, then you can still keep everything as it was.

           Removed the 'Tab Rows' setting from indicator tabs as there is no need for them anymore. We have a
           limit of 3 rows that can be easily increased if the need arises and is more dynamic now.

           Removed the indicator panel tab. I found it to be cumbersome and a little clunky. It would be
           better to just click on the indicator to change the settings, add or delete etc. That is now
           implemented. Right click on the indicator to bring up the context menu. The only thing that
           is missing is the instant on/off of indicators in the list. Not a big deal as I don't think
           it was used much.

           Put back the old 'new indicator' toolbar button on the main toolbar.

           Moved a lot of code from QtstalkerApp into ChartLayout class. Moving towards the QtstalkerApp
           class containing just the init and glue code for all the gui objects.

           Changed the bar length buttons on the toolbar to a control scheme that uses much less space. It
           was taking up too much room on the toolbar.

           Added an option to the CSV plugin to try to remove any file suffix from the file name when using
           the filename as the symbol name.

           Right justified all the gui elements in order to keep mouse travel to a minimum.

           The QuoteServer is now being used. It starts under qtstalker control. Users will have to import
           their quotes into the QuoteServer. User scripts will also have to be modified to import data using
           the QuoteServer. There are some sample scripts provided in the QuoteServer/scripts directory.
           The QuoteServer runs in localhost mode for best speed. This may change in the future if users would
           like to run the server on a network to serve qtstalker clients once the server has matured and is
           stable enough for heavy network usage. Might have to also compress the data stream if users want
           to run on a network. We will see.

20100722:  Removed the script refresh options from the script side panel. It would be better to let scripts do
           the refreshing the way they want instead of imposing one way on them from the app. Also removed
           the save/load running scripts when qtstalker is restarted. Lets not assume the user wants to have the
           scripts restarted if there is some problem with them.

           Fixed symbol search dialog bug. Option for all exchanges ('*') search was missing.

           Now back due to popular demand, added the toggle show/hide side panel button back on the toolbar.

           Added tab size settings to the chart tab dialog. Now you can adjust the sizes of the tabs depending
           on their orientation. My personal pet peeve now put to rest.

           Added symbol selection to the yahoo plugin for downloading. This allows only what symbols selected
           to be updated. Converted dialogs to non blocking.

20100726:  Removed the PLOT script command and replaced it with 3 new INDICATOR command options. SET_PLOT,
           SET_COLOR_ALL and SET_PLOT_STYLE. see docs. NOTE: users with personal indicator scripts will
           have to update them to reflect the new changes.

           Moved the TA-Lib wrapper code from the indicator plugins to the library for better availability.

           Fixed 0 bars returned from the QuoteServer bug that segs qtstalker.

           Plot types no longer inherits from PlotLine. Code was spun off into smaller classes so it is more
           efficient to change PlotLine style types.

           Removed the PLOT_TYPE and COLOR parms from each of the indicators in the INDICATOR api.
           These are now determined when needed in the script using the new commands mentioned above.
           NOTE: please update your personal scripts to reflect these changes.

           Removed the script api to the VOL plugin. This was redundant by other commands.

           Added option to restart the QuoteServer if the port number is changed.

           Re-arranged the script launcher buttons on the script panel from 2 rows to 3 so that we can shrink
           the size of the side panel a little more.

- Removed the -ldl linker parm from all *.pro files. This was a legacy issue, no longer needed.
  Now compiles on FreeBSD just like on Linux. Yea baby.

- Updated CC plugin to allow for rollover control. Number used is days from last trading day to
  rollover to the next contract. This can be a lengthy process to run this plugin as it has to rebuild each chart
  from scratch every time you update. Allow for a few minutes to complete. Also added a maximum years
  parm to limit the size of the chart.

- Updated HLC plugin to follow Donchian rule.

- Removed the charts from the backtesting dialog. This was bloat and fluff we don't need. Everything that is 
  important is in the summary.
  
- Added a global font preference for the app.

- Changed the dialogs to edit most values in place instead of popping up a dialog.

- Made some GUI changes to the toolbar. Replaced chart type and chart compression buttons with combo boxes.

- Changed chart object creation to be alot simpler. After selecting an object to create, just click on the chart and the
  object will be created without user interaction.

- Made a major GUI change by adding a tabbed section on the left of the main screen. This area can be used to expand
  stuff in the future. I merged all the chart, group, portfolio and backtest dialogs onto the tabs. This allows quick and easy
  access to all the major stuff without having to bring up dialogs all the time. To navigate through a group, just use the mouse
  or the keyboard arrow keys to move back and forth.

- Added start and end date controls to the Yahoo plugin for more precise downloads. Hopefully this will solve some of the
  foreign quote problems.
  
- Did some tuning to various classes for better speed and memory usage.

- Added individual pixmaps for each type chart object for better id.

- Updated the docs.

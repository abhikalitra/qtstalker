          right edge of the chart.

20050110: Added a timeout parm to the yahoo plugin. This sets how many seconds are allowed

	  time to complete, the download will abort and move on to the next symbol.
	  
20050112: Fixed bug in crosshair draws that didn't draw on the left edge of plot.

20050113: Fixed yahoo plugin to download symbols in sorted order.

          arrow. If drawmode is off then cursor is a cross.
	  
20050116: The export chart function now saves the original db path so the QtstalkerFormat
          plugin can restore it properly without having to manually move the imported chart.

          before start point.
	  
20050122: As per user request, the yahoo plugin now preloads all stock symbols as a default so
          that the user need not bring up the dialog to select symbols. Once the yahoo plugin is selected
	  from the quotes dialog the user can just start the update.
	  
20050122: Moved the 'CH=' info on the main chart info line to the left. This is so at least
          the unique data here is still visible on a small chart.
	  
20050122: MySQLPlugin now checks for any deleted symbols before downloading and updates it's
          symbol list.

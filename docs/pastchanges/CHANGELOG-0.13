- I have gone plugin crazy. Almost every chart feature will be a dll plugin library.
  Chart types, indicators, quote sources, chart objects will be plugins.
  So far, chart types, indicators, quote sources, are now plugins.
  I will make chart objects plugins in the future.

- chart objects can be applied to all plots

- plot size now adjustable by using the splitter

- common gui method for changing parameters in dialogs

- redesigned the plot widget to be more OO

- using gdbm for db functions, removed the db dependicies, I am sick and tired of db upgrades
  and version changes

- removed the glib dependecies

- added paint bars chart type

- moved all data except tick data, to ASCII format for headache reduction

- space between bars can be changed now

- 2 scaling styles now, scale to entire data series and scale to screen

- changed indicator tabs to a toolbar with buttons

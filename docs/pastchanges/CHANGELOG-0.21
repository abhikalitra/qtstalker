- Fixed the resize bug with the side panel causing the annoying plot resizes.

- Shortened the labels that appear in the side panel to minimize space.

- Removed the Volume label from the side panel when mouse is over the main chart. It should only appear in the VOL chart.

- Applied patch from David Crossley for the CSV plugin docs.

- Fixed a bug that would segfault if there was only 1 bar to plot.

- Applied 3 patches for PP color and several docs from David Crossley.

- Applied preliminary exhaustion bar patch from David Crossley. This is a new chart type see docs for details.

- Changed the name of the Qtstalker quotes plugin to QtstalkerFormat. This was to keep from confusing object files with the
  main program.
  
- Finally changed the compiling process to a regular './configure;make;make install' format. To do this I had to re-organize the
  entire source tree. The executable 'qtstalker' will now be put into /usr/bin. The plugins will be created in /usr/lib/qtstalker.
  The docs will go into /usr/share/doc/qtstalker. This seems to be the most popular choice (at least with Gentoo and Debian)
  
- Removed the install plugins stuff. Not really needed since all you have to do is plop the lib into the dir for it to work.

- Rewrote the paint bar functions in Plot class to accept colors from indicator plugins. Added a new function to Plugin class
  to handle color bars from indicators.

- New indicator Exhaustion Points (EP). This was originally code from Plot class that was moved into an indicator instead.

- New line type "Invisible" added. This allows data plots to be hidden, but the data to be visible in the side panel or data window.

- Color bars were off by one in the EP indicator. Fixed.

- Removed CBOT plugin from the compile process pending a future fix or removal.

- Fixed the change field in the main chart to display only decimal numbers.

- Applied patch #788557 for EP docs from David Crossley.

- Applied patch #788595 for new indicator MMA from David Crossley.

- Changed SettingView class to remove user sorting of the table. Instead the key sorting will be done internally.

- Applied patch #789058 from David Crossley to fix candles not being drawn properly when open == close.

- Changed some functions in Qtstalker class to use signals to make Plot class parm changes.

- Applied patch #791519 from Marco van Zwetselaar to add .cvsignore files to the source tree.

- Applied patch #792296 from David Crossley for new indicator FI (force index).

- Added new Config option NavigatorPosition that allows user to place the chart navigator on the left or right side. The
  default is left side. This setting is edited in the preferences dialog. Checked means left side. Unchecked means right side.

- Added new option to all MA's to displace them if desired. 0 for no displacement and > 0 for bars of displacement. Updated the
  MA, MA2, MA3, MMA plugins with the new parm.

- Removed Ratio quote plugin. Moved ratio functions into the Spread quote plugin.

- Applied patch #806926 from David Crossley.

- Put a lebel in the group navigator tab to indicate what the current group is.

- Fixed Yahoo quote plugin to accept yahoo format change (Adj. Close*) on 2003.09.17.

- Renamed /src/Qtstalker.pro to src.pro to fix problem with qmake logic on some distributions.

- CSV plugin updated to accept date ranges, delimiter types and date format.

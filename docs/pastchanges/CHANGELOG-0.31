20050517: Bug fix release. In order to make the upgrade easier for users from 0.29
          the storage path was changed from ~/Qtstalker to ~/.qtstalker/data0 This helps users
          start with a fresh clean directory to minimze upgrade pain. The data0 directory is for
          future upgrade issues in case we need to start fresh again, we will use data1, data2 etc.

20050517: Fixed bug with Line plugin. On startup the default was not working causing no
          plot to be drawn.

20050517: Added a warning dialog that appears on startup reminding users of the upgrade issues.

20050519: Added removal of the ~/.qt/qtstalkerrc file if user is upgrading from 0.29. We need to
          start with a fresh clean settings file or things will break.

20050519: Fixed bug in MySQL plugin that does not create the new directory structure /Stocks/MySQL

20050519: Changed all the plugins to use a common include file plugin.config. Yay! Now I don't have
          to modify all those bloody pro files...thanks Jim!

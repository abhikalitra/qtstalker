20040614: applied patch #972357 - new indicator VFI. Thanks to Xiaoguang Zhang.

20040615: applied patch #972868,972870 - VFI and Tester exit changes. Thanks to Xiaoguang Zhang.

20040615: fixed bug #972949 - yahoo Y2K bug. qtstalker was assuming any dates <1950 was a 
          21st century date. The yahoo history data only goes back to 1930, so cutoff date
	  is changed to anything before 1930 will be considered a 21st century date.
	    
20040620: fixed bug in WMA that causes a segfault. period was off by one for second loop.

20040621: fixed bug in BB that switched labels for upper and lower bands.

20040622: fixed bug #976814 in EMA logic that applied smoothing factor to the first value. now just a plain
          SMA value unsmoothed.
	  
20040622: changed Tester:: class to non-modal dialog for multiple instances. testing needed.

20040624: fixed bug in MOM, ROC, SD indicators that plots a blank chart.

20040624: fixed bugs in OVRLY indicator that displayed erratic behaviour.

20040626: fixed bug that didn't restore stacked indicators space defaults on startup. now it
          restores the default size of 75.
	  
20040628: fixed bug in PP indicator that didn't save linetype correctly.

20040704: New indicator plugin CUS. This allows the user to create custom indicator
          formulas. See DOCS for more info on usage.
	  
20040706: Changed the navigator gui from tabs to small buttons. Having to page back and forth
          to access all the tabs was becoming tiresome. Ahhh, much better being able to see and
	  select all the buttons at once.

20040710: Rough version of the symbol scanner is now included. Will be improving as time goes on.
          Need to update DOCS.

20040711: Changed the PaintBars chart type to use a custom formula to draw the paint bars. In order
          for it to work, the last step must be a COMP function that is checked to plot. This is the
	  boolean array that will be used to draw the paint bars. If the COMP function returns
	  TRUE than the bar will be considered an up bar. A FALSE value will be a down bar.
	  Need to update DOCS.
	  
20040717: Changed the Line chart type to use a custom formula to plot. Now more flexible to use
          a user defined formula rather than the hard coded options. The last step that is checked
	  to plot will be the one to plot. Need to update DOCS.

20040724: Applied patches #997264 - single pass optimisation for SMA, #997252 - cvsignore updates.
          Thanks to Marco van Zwetselaar.

20040728: Removed all the alert functions from all classes. The base plugin class was modified,
          so we have to bump up all the lib and plugin versions from 0.26 to 0.27. qtstalker now only loads
	  version 0.27 plugins.

20040729: Changed the back testing gui and logic to use the new CUS user language to create
          enter/exit rules instead of using the alert functions in the indicator plugins. The new
	  system is not backwards compatible with the old one, so you will need to re-create any
	  testing rules you already have. Need to update DOCS.
	  
20040730: Added value labels to fibo objects to display when adjusting the various levels in real
          time. Also fixed fonts for values to use local font instead of system default.
	  
20040730: Added a chart page to the back testing module. First chart is an equity line that
          plots the account balance. The second chart is a line plot of the symbol close with
	  the buy/sell points marked for each signal. Replaced the date range parms with a bars
	  counter instead.
	  
20040730: Added option to extend trendlines into the future in the edit dialog. Default is true.

20040801: Applied patch #1001473 - PlotLine bug in Tester::. Thanks to Xiaoguang Zhang.

20040801: Changed the method of entering/editing CUS rules in FormulaEdit:: to use a dialog
          for each function in order to keep correct grammer. The user has to use the dialog
	  now instead of entering functions by hand. Hopefully we can remove all the potential
	  user errors so I don't have to code error checking for every parm. sigh.....

20040801: Added trade delays for each backtester rule for enter/exit. Also added an apply button
          to the backtester dialog which saves the backtester rule at the user's wish.
	  
20040805: Removed the QSMath class and merged all it's code back into the indicator plugins.
          Figured out how the plugins can use other plugins now, so we can keep plugin framework
	  totaly OO in design. Bit of a speed hit, but barely noticable on a slow machine.
	  
20040805: New indicator plugins to be used for the CUS language. COMP, used to compare 2 data arrays
          and return a boolean array. MATH, used to add, divide, multiply or subtract to data arrays.
	  REF, returns a data array of bar values (open, close etc.). Need to update DOCS.
	  
20040805: Applied patch #1002999 - volume in tester. Thanks to Xiaoguang Zhang.

20040805: Plugins removed: MA2, MA3, MMA. Trying to reduce the number of plugins, these plugins
          are easily reproduced by using a CUS formula.

20040807: Added ability to create sub-groups in the chart group panel.

20040807: Tester now saves/loads the results of a test run.

20040812: Applied patch #1007570 - displacements in COMP. Thanks to Xiaoguang Zhang.

20040815: Modified the plugin base class and the indicator plugins to save custom parms in a new way
          that doesn't depend on field order. Developers will have to recreate any custom indicators,
	  tester rules etc. Also a complete recompile will be needed to update the plugins.
	  
20040815: Removed OI indicator plugin. Easily replaced by using a REF custom function now. Part
          of a plugin consolidation revue in progress.
	  
20040815: Merged WAD plugin with the AD plugin. Removed WAD.

20040815: Merged OBV,NVI,PVI,PVT plugins into new VT (Volume Trends) plugin. Removed OBV,NVI,PVI,PVT.

20040815: Removed STOCHRSI. Can easily be reproduced by a CUS formula.

20040816: Removed HLC. Can easily be reproduced by a CUS formula. Added MIN/MAX functions to the MATH plugin.

20040816: Added option for all indicators to be placed either on the main chart, the tabbed charts or
          stacked positions. Now users's can place them anywhere. Beware, some indicators placed on
	  the main chart will mess the chart up because of scaling differences ie. VOL.

20040817: Added an insert step function to the FormulaEdit widget, improving the editing of CUS
          formulas.

20040821: Moved Indicator class into qtstalkerlib so that plugins could return an Indicator
          instead of individual PlotLines.
	  
20040825: New class of plugins added. db plugins will be used to manage storage of bar and chart
          data. This allows more efficient use of storage, editing and extendibility. The plugins
	  added so far are Stocks, Futures, Index, Spread and CC. 
	  
20040825: Removed quote plugins CC, Spread, Index. No longer needed.

20040825: Fixed bug in COMP plugin that created problems parsing parms using the "=" as the
          delimiter. Had to change all the COMP operators to use abbreviations ie. GT instead of >.
	  
20040826: Added custom long and short stops to the tester module.

20040901: Removed Plugin class to better separate the various plugin classes to make less
          dependancies between plugin classes.
	  
20040902: Added copy rule to the backtester page.
	  
20040902: Added CUS rule respository ~/Qtstalker/cusrules. The FormulaEdit widget can now
          open and save rules that are being edited. The rules can be used by any FormulaEdit
	  using module.
	  
20040907: Added refresh option to the context menu for the group page.

20040907: Fixed bug that accepts search characters when creating indicators. This applies
          to any filename in qtstalker. Only number and alphabet characters are valid now.
	  
20040907: Scanner and backtest dialogs now display the name in the window titles.

20040912: Created new class of plugins for chart objects. Continuing the process of maximum
          modularity and flexibility. Moved chart object code classes from /src and created
	  a COPlugin class for each one.
	  
20040913: Applied patch #1025390 - indicator plugin COUNTER. This is used for CUS rules that
          allow the user to count COMP signals and have a method of using the number of
	  consecutive TRUE signals. Thanks to Xiaoguang Zhang for the plugin.
	  
20040913: Applied patch #1026411 - customizable displace in COMP indicator. Thanks to
          Xiaoguang Zhang for the patch.
	  
20040914: Fixed bug #1028142 with patch to fix seg faults on FormulaEdit insert function.
          Thanks to Xiaoguang Zhang for the patch.
	  
20040916: A logic error was found in the DMI indicator that returned smaller +DI and -DI values.
          Fixed that as well as optimised speed.
	  
20040918: Finally fixed signal propagation for the indicator tabs. Now the user can delete all the
          tabs if desired. YAY!
	  
20040919: Added progress dialogs to Scanner and Tester.

20040920: Added help dialogs to all the plugins. 

20040920: Added -ffast-math compiler option to all *.pro files. There is a noticable improvement
          in speed. Very cool.
	  
20040922: Changed the quotes dialog to be modeless.

20040922: Added help functions to menus and dialogs.

Description:
------------

qtstalker is a basic end of day Technical Analysis package with many features. It compares with
similar commercial products like Metastok, Superchartz, Tradestation(...maybe one day) etc.
If you are familiar with those, then you should be able to muddle along with qtstalker.

I develop qtstalker on GNU/Linux and have not tested it on any other systems. I have been told from
time to time that it is possible to compile on other systems like FreeBSD, Solaris, IRIX and yes even
windows. So, I can really only help users using GNU/Linux systems with bugs and problems.

For more info read the CHANGELOG and FAQ files.
For installation instructions, fire up ypur browser and look at docs/index.html

To compile you will need these packages installed (see the docs/index.html file for instructions)

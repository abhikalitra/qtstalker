    <h1>Indicator: cdl-rel: Relative Candles</h1>
    <p>This document describes the example <a href="../cus.html#examples">CUS</a>
      indicator at
      <code>misc/CUS_examples/cdl-rel</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The candle colour is relative to the previous bar.
      An empty box (traditionally white) candle body means that the close was
      higher than the open. A solid (traditionally black) candle body means
      that the close was lower than the open. Colour adds another dimension.
      Red is a lower close than the previous close. Green is a higher close.
      Blue indicates no change from the previous close.

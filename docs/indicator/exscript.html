    <h1>Indicator: ExScript: External Script</h1>
    <p>
      The "ExScript" indicator passes data to an external program and then plots
      the output that is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
     See the example <a href="../cus.html#examples">CUS</a> indicator at
      <code>misc/CUS_examples/Contributions/xley/ExScript</code>
    </p>
    <p>Copy the companion Perl program ExScript.pl to somewhere in your home
     directory. Now edit the indicator example to refer to that pathname.
    </p>
<pre>
# That example indicator outputs just the "date,volume" for each bar, as well
# as the commandline argument scaleFactor, and calls this Perl script.
# The script calculates the average of all bars, gets the difference
# from average and scales it. The script then passes the data back to the
# indicator which plots it as a "Histogram Bar". It is a silly example which
# could be done directly as a CUS script, but it gives an idea of the power.
#
# For example, it could also be enhanced to access the xml summary which
# is exported using the "Tools => IndicatorSummary".

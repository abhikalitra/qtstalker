To Do:
======

- create some howto docs for quote plugins
- add MA option to all plugins?
- drag and drop chart objects
- chart scanner
- intraday quotes
- postgresql quote plugin
- key bindings
- key binding scripting
- add alerts to SZ & THERM plugins

Maybe some day:
===============

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- Intraday charting.

- support for options

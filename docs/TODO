To Do:
======

- Next priority is to start creating the back testing functions.

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- Intraday charting.

- support for options

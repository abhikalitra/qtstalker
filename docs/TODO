To Do:
======

- create some howto docs for indicators
- allow negative displacement for line plots
- add more crosshairs behaviours to IndicatorPlot
- save last chart viewed between sessions.
- median lines chart objects
- fibo time chart objects
- update classes with a description of purpose, usage etc.
- Round off values to lesser precision when displaying in data panel.
- Improve source code documentation. Javadoc comments are utilised by Doxygen.
- create an integrated indicator editor.
- add tooltips
- interactive scripting


Priority
========

- documentation
- link to other apps via button control panel
- decide what to fill the lower right plot corner with...
- add user defined script launch buttons to the script panel
- add more function buttons for all the panels (not just the menus) - use actions for this



Maybe some day:

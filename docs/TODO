To Do:
======

- create some howto docs for quote plugins
- postgresql quote plugin
- key bindings
- key binding scripting
- trendlines and fibo objects to plot on weekly and monthly charts as well
- make a freshmeat entry
- allow negative displacement for line plots
- create a package of CUS indicators, default CSV plugin import rules to the install process
  so users have a bunch of examples and things to play with
- change Quote behaviour in yahoo plugin to create separate symbols for intraday and daily
  data. also put a timer on yahoo plugin for intraday tick downloads every X minutes. same limitations
  will apply as in the CSV timer
- overhaul CSV plugin to allow URL downloads and clean up code...it's a mess  
- add more crosshairs behaviours to IndicatorPlot
- user defined bar lengths for intraday charts
- add remember last file used for CSV plugin.
- add a loop counter function to the COUNTER plugin
- add better icons for add/insert in the edit formula dialog widget, functions not obvious
- create CUS tutorial.
- add more indicator functions to existing plugins ie. Chaikin, Volume osc's etc.
- add stock margins to the tester

- *******before 0.33 put in routine in config to remove old CUS format files:*************
	~/.qtstalker/data0/cusrules 
  	~/.qtstalker/data0/scanner 
	~/.qtstalker/data0/test
	~/.qtstalker/data0/indicator (only remove CUS types and leave the rest)
        add some default indicators to replace the bar/candle/line chart styles

- add ability to not draw sections of plotlines. (vectors)
- save last chart viewed between sessions.
- fix: bug in tester: does not exit trade and enter new one within the same bar.



Maybe some day:
===============

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- support for options

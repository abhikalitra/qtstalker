To Do:
======

- create some howto docs for quote plugins
- postgresql quote plugin
- key bindings
- key binding scripting
- fix trendlines and fibo objects to plot on weekly and monthly charts as well
- make a freshmeat entry
- allow negative displacement for line plots
- add indicator chart to the tester chart so buy/sell points have a reference
- allow log/scale to screen options on the tester charts

- add co plugin icons back to the context menus
- switching tab indicators does not redraw the crosshairs
- add yahoo plugin function to download fundamental data when a new symbol is created
- add some default CSV plugin import rules
- fix: defaults set chart objects for one plot is not set for all plots during session. only after a restart. 
- fix: crosshair redraws are sometimes incomplete
- change zoom behaviour to keep chart centered
- add export symbol feature in CSV format


Maybe some day:
===============

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- support for options

To Do:
======

- create some howto docs for quote plugins
- postgresql quote plugin
- key bindings
- key binding scripting
- trendlines and fibo objects to plot on weekly and monthly charts as well
- make a freshmeat entry
- allow negative displacement for line plots
- default CSV plugin import rules to the install process
- change Quote behaviour in yahoo plugin to create separate symbols for intraday and daily
  data. also put a timer on yahoo plugin for intraday tick downloads every X minutes. same limitations
  will apply as in the CSV timer
- overhaul CSV plugin to allow URL downloads and clean up code...it's a mess  
- add more crosshairs behaviours to IndicatorPlot
- user defined bar lengths for intraday charts
- add better icons for add/insert in the edit formula dialog widget, functions not obvious
- create CUS tutorial.
- add stock margins to the tester
- add ability to not draw sections of plotlines. (vectors)
- save last chart viewed between sessions.
- change absolute path names in the tester rules to relative so files can be moved
- add paper trade mode to portfolio tracker (use last chart value instead of last db value)
- add optimization range testing for the backtester.
- integrate TALIB into the indicator base class and remove the TALIB plugin.
- fix: negative account volume trades in the tester.
- add: there is no way to use buy/sell prices in stop formulas in the tester. 
- median lines chart objects
- fibo time chart objects
- add: an include option for CUS rules to include other CUS rules. ie. INCLUDECUS("sma50x200up")
- add: a data window function for charts/groups that table indicator values.
- add: add a timeout function to ExScript so it doesn't wait in loop forever with no input.
- add: a drop down button list to bar spacing so that users can flip back and forth to their fav bar spacing settings.
- add: restore the last price arrow on the scale charts



Maybe some day:
===============

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- support for options

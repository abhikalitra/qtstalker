To Do:
======

  https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4527886
- allow negative displacement for line plots
- add more crosshairs behaviours to IndicatorPlot
- user defined bar lengths for intraday charts
- add ability to not draw sections of plotlines. (vectors)
- save last chart viewed between sessions.
- median lines chart objects
- fibo time chart objects
- display chart object info when cursor hovers over them in the data panel or make tooltip.
- update classes with a description of purpose, usage etc.
- Round off values to lesser precision when displaying in data panel.
- Improve source code documentation. Javadoc comments are utilised by Doxygen.
- Experiment with SVN trunk version of TA-Lib. Provide feedback to them if we have issues. Their 0.5 release is scheduled for January 2008.

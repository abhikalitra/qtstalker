To Do:
======

- create some howto docs for quote plugins
- postgresql quote plugin
- key bindings
- key binding scripting
- fix trendlines and fibo objects to plot on weekly and monthly charts as well
- make a freshmeat entry
- allow negative displacement for line plots
- add indicator chart to the tester chart so buy/sell points have a reference
- create a package of CUS indicators, default CSV plugin import rules to the install process
  so users have a bunch of examples and things to play with
- rename indicator function (possible main plot indicator panel revision)
- fix: stacked indicator widget insertion resizing is ugly.
- allow point selection on plots to display values past the ends of the chart. (future dates and values)
- change Quote behaviour in yahoo plugin to create separate symbols for intraday and daily
  data. also put a timer on yahoo plugin for intraday tick downloads every X minutes. same limitations
  will apply as in the CSV timer
- create a date range for loading charts, then step through bar by bar to simulate paper trading
- put a paint bars function for candles (replace volume candles with CUS?)
- overhaul CSV plugin to allow URL downloads and clean up code...it's a mess  
- put in left/right chart justify option.
- update docs to explain why Bars:paintbar is blank if no rule is set.
- add more crosshairs behaviours to IndicatorPlot
- user defined bar lengths for intraday charts
- fix: preferences font changes does not propagate to chart objects
- add remember last file used for CSV plugin.
- add a loop counter function to the COUNTER plugin
- add multiple positions to the backtester
- add better icons for add/insert in the edit formula dialog widget, functions not obvious
- change backtester/scanner edit formula widgets to remove plot/scale option fields from the list
  they dont apply and confuse users. try to remove unused gui options 
- change edit formula widgets to auto add the missing COMP step instead of warning user.
- create CUS tutorial.
- add more indicator functions to existing plugins ie. Chaikin, Volume osc's etc.
- fix: chart status data covers candles on the main chart.
- add stock margins to the tester
- add intraday trading to the tester



Maybe some day:
===============

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- support for options

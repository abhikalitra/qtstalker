To Do:
======

- create some howto docs for quote plugins
- postgresql quote plugin
- key bindings
- key binding scripting
- fix trendlines and fibo objects to plot on weekly and monthly charts as well
- make a freshmeat entry
- allow negative displacement for line plots
- add indicator chart to the tester chart so buy/sell points have a reference
- allow log/scale to screen options on the tester charts
- make quotes dialog modal again
- cancel update does not work with yahoo plugin when not paused.
- fix yahoo auto update and retry functions
- add co plugin icons back to the context menus
- add fibo levels to the defaults settings
- fix fibo levels higher than high and low points bug
- switching tab indicators does not redraw the crosshairs


Maybe some day:
===============

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- support for options

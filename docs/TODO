To Do:
======

ASAP:
=====

- shifting left/right option for MA's
- create some howto docs for quote plugins
- add MA option to all plugins?


Maybe some day:
===============

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- Intraday charting.

- support for options

- port to osx broken plugin system

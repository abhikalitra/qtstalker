To Do:
======

- create some howto docs for quote plugins
- postgresql quote plugin
- key bindings
- key binding scripting
- add subgroups to groups ability
- update plugin howto for BarData usage
- fix trendlines and fibo objects to plot on weekly and monthly charts as well
- make a freshmeat entry
- context sensitive help
- allow negative displacement for line plots


Maybe some day:
===============

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- support for options

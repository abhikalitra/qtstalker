To Do:
======

- create some howto docs for quote plugins
- postgresql quote plugin
- key bindings
- key binding scripting
- fix trendlines and fibo objects to plot on weekly and monthly charts as well
- make a freshmeat entry
- allow negative displacement for line plots
- add indicator chart to the tester chart so buy/sell points have a reference
- allow log/scale to screen options on the tester charts
- add co plugin icons back to the context menus
- add yahoo plugin function to download fundamental data when a new symbol is created
- add some default CSV plugin import rules
- add export symbol feature in CSV format

-Scanner: I would expect the "Apply" button to store the current settings, like stock selection
and bars/compression, as in the backtester. In the scanner, however, only the CUS indicator is saved. 
  
-In the CUS indicator inserting of a new element does not lead to a renumbering of references in
elements below. Example: 
Existing CUS 
a) ref close 
c) ref volume 
d) MA volume 
  
and then the following line #2 is inserted  
b) ma close 
  
the reference in d) to c) is not updated with the new numbering, so that it still points to line number 2,
which is now "ma close".  


Maybe some day:
===============

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- support for options

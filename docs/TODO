To Do:
======

- create some howto docs for quote plugins
- postgresql quote plugin
- key bindings
- key binding scripting
- fix trendlines and fibo objects to plot on weekly and monthly charts as well
- make a freshmeat entry
- allow negative displacement for line plots
- add indicator chart to the tester chart so buy/sell points have a reference
- create a package of CUS indicators, default CSV plugin import rules to the install process
  so users have a bunch of examples and things to play with
- rename indicator function (possible main plot indicator panel revision)
- allow indicator plugins to allow for choosing a plugin as a smoothing option.
- fix: stacked indicator widget insertion resizing is ugly.
- allow point selection on plots to display values past the ends of the chart. (future dates and values)
- allow individual indicators to be applied to individual charts
- add scaling option for CUS plots.
- change Quote behaviour in yahoo plugin to create separate symbols for intraday and daily
  data. also put a timer on yahoo plugin for intraday tick downloads every X minutes. same limitations
  will apply as in the CSV timer
  

Maybe some day:
===============

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- support for options

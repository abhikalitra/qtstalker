To Do:
======

- create some howto docs for quote plugins
- postgresql quote plugin
- key bindings
- key binding scripting
- fix trendlines and fibo objects to plot on weekly and monthly charts as well
- make a freshmeat entry
- allow negative displacement for line plots
- add indicator chart to the tester chart so buy/sell points have a reference
- allow log/scale to screen options on the tester charts
- create a package of CUS indicators, default CSV plugin import rules to the install process
  so users have a bunch of examples and things to play with
- rename indicator function (possible main plot indicator panel revision)
- allow indicator plugins to allow for choosing a plugin as a smoothing option.
- scanner saves symbols selected between sessions
- apply specific indicators to specific symbols (not sure about this one)
- run multiple scanners
- allow position of indicators to be changed. Tabbed, Stacked etc.
- fix: stacked indicator widget insertion resizing is ugly, to to fix.
- allow point selection on plots to display values past the ends of the chart. (future dates and values)
- global keyboard shortcuts for chart panning
- add a reload timer to the CSV plugin
- add a chart reload timer to toolbar



Maybe some day:
===============

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- support for options

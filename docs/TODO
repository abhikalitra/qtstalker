To Do:
======

- documentation

- add more cursor behaviours to Plot
- median lines chart objects
- fibo time chart objects
- update classes with a description of purpose, usage etc.
- Improve source code documentation. Javadoc comments are utilised by Doxygen.
- interactive scripting
- complete backtesting plugins
- add yahoo details code selection to the yahoo plugin (default is only name now)
- chart zooming
- add a date widget to charts that mimic 'the new style' we see on yahoo and google charts.
- add defaults to all the plugins so we can cut down on explicit parms
- implement 0.36 crosshair behaviour


Priority
========

To Do:
======

- documentation
- create some howto docs for indicators
- add more cursor behaviours to Plot
- save last chart viewed between sessions.
- median lines chart objects
- fibo time chart objects
- update classes with a description of purpose, usage etc.
- Round off values to lesser precision when displaying in data panel.
- Improve source code documentation. Javadoc comments are utilised by Doxygen.
- add tooltips
- interactive scripting
- complete backtesting module
- add exchange checker to yahoo plugin symbols dialog
- add yahoo details code selection to the yahoo plugin (default is only name now)
- add some qtstalker plugins to display details data from QuoteServer
- add search method to quoteserver details plugin
- add some example rules to the CSV plugin so noobs have an idea of construction (wait till release)
- chart zooming
- add script API for notifications for alerts.


Priority
========

BUG: some gnome ubuntu themes have issues with qtstalker indicator tab resizing. displays tiny tabs with misplaced text.
     the only workarounds are avoiding use of east/west tabs or experimenting with different themes. default gnome
     theme we know does not work. kubuntu and Qt based themes work.

BUG: check indicator dialog input dialogs for forbidden sql chars in text inputs
- add help to dialogs


Maybe some day:
===============

- support for options

<h2><u>Point and Figure Chart<br>
</u></h2>
<p>Qtstalker version of Point and Figure uses a general box sizing
formula. The formula is calculated by taking the increment of the
current chart scale and divide that by 4. A 3 box reversal is also
used. The other difference is no X's or O's are used, instead we use
colors. Color up is used for X's and Color Down is used for O's. Much
easier to gauge at a glance and stays in keeping with other chart type
uses of color. Note that Qtstalker uses a time based style that allows
you to overlay indicators.</p>

20061119: Changed quote plugin dialogs to all appear in one dialog. You can have a separate dialog window for each quote
          plugin if you like and leave them open, minimized, whatever. This helps with eventually having real-time quotes
          running in the background with no blocking to the main app.

20061120: Applied patch #1600028 - update install notes for Mac symlink db4.

20061120: Added new UTIL functions Higher and Lower. These functions return either the higher or lower value of 2
          arrays or an array and constant.

20061123: Removed QtstalkerFormat quote plugin. It's redundant now. The chart panel can dump files,
          CSV can import them and the berkeley db suite has utilities for dumping and rebuilding 
          files.

20061127: Fixed LOWPASS bug that returned the input instead of the ouput.

20061130: Added Charts or Groups option to the scanner dialog. If charts is chosen, the file selector will
          allow only chart directories to be navigated. If Groups is chosen, then only group directories
          can be navigated.

20061201: Fixed bug in backtster that sefaults using < 0.33 CUS syntax.

20061203: Added new indicator plugin ExScript. User can run external scripts that can pass data back to ExScript
          to plot.

20061204: Fixed bug that did not save/restore chart pixelspaces.

20061205: Added options to send bar data through stdin to the ExScript plugin.

20061205: Applied patch #1609188 - modified util.html. Thanks to Lothar for the patch.

20061205: Added new UTIL function INRANGE. Returns TRUE if value is => min and <= max. Otherwise returns FALSE.

20061206: Changed the minimum bar spacing to 2.

20061207: Changed the info panel window to list date,time,open,high,low,close,volume,oi first.

20061207: Added edit chart option to the chart context menu.

20061207: Keyboard delete key now deletes charts from the chart/group panels.

20061207: Added function 'Add To Group' to the chart panel context menu. Allows the user to add the selected
          chart to the group chosen. Saves a few steps by not going through the group panel menus.

20061208: Added 3 new buttons on the chart toolbar that act as default bar spacing settings. The user can set the defaults
          in the preferences dialog.

20061208: Restored the last close arrow on the scale charts.

20061208: Added a timeout function to ExScript so it doesn't wait in loop forever with no input.

20061208: Fixed bug in CUS formulas if Label field in plot settings left blank, line would not plot.

20061208: Fixed bug in TALIB plugin that did not set the correct MA for CUS scripts that used the STOCH function.

20061208: Added RSI and STOCH to the misc/CUS_examples section. Examples on how to code zone lines in indicators.

20061209: Added new CUS feature. INCLUDECUS(xxx). This allows the user to include other CUS rules. This is helpful when
          making changes to one indicator, changes will be propagated to all scripts that use the included indicator.
          Not thoroughly tested yet. Careful how you combine different indicators. Any duplicate variable names will
          abort the calculation. Mixing indicators that have different scaling properties will result in awful looking charts.

20061210: Added new function Indicator Summary groups that display the latest indicator values for a selected group. The function
          assumes to use the currently loaded indicators to use. Function found on the tools menu. Function will (hopefully) be
          refined with more options in the future.

20061211: Added DonchianChannels to the misc/CUS_examples/Contributions/sstratos section.

20061212: When editing CUS rules, the 'Open Rule' function inserts text instead of relacing text.

20061213: Applied patch #1615024 - workwithscanner.html update. Thanks to loh_tar for the patch

20061213: Applied patch #1614530 - IndicatorSummary xml export. Thanks to David for the patch.

          open button was used to close the dialog instead of double clicking on the selection.

20061214: Fixed splits to adjust volume.

20061214: Fixed default chart object font changes that do not propagate.

20061214: Applied patch #1616118 - Add to Group Icon - thanks to loh_tar for the patch.

20061214: Applied patch #1615526 - update FAQ: Mac OS X works fine. Thanks to David for the patch.

20061214: Applied patch #1615490 - add INCLUDECUS to examples and docs. Thanks to David for the patch.

20061221: Converted the DB functions to a new format that centralizes the chart metadata into a main index.
          Also changed the chart format to a fixed record size to achieve a 60% speed increase for loading
          and inserting data. Added a conversion dialog that will appear when the new code is started.
          Conversion will take under 10 minutes for 7000 charts.

20061221: Applied patch #1620276 - modified docs, pref,tool,main,wrkcharts/groups - thanks to loh_tar for the patch.

20061221: Applied patch #1616417 - again modified util.html - thanks to loh_tar for the patch.

20061226: Added Point and Figure charts to the BARS indicator. The 'Default' method box sizing is a simple formula:
          2% of the mid point of bars displayed. Set method to 'Custom' to set the box size and reversal parms for
          each individual chart.

20061226: Some CUS_examples indicators are now installed by default on fresh installs.

20061226: Removed the 0.31 conversion functions. Everyone should have upgraded by now. If not...too bad.

20061226: Removed the 12.5k shorthand from chart scaling. I would rather see 12500.

20061226: Just a note that with the new metadata indexing, you will not be able to create multiple charts with the same
          symbol name. Even when located in a differnent directory. We have one symbol universe now.

20070101: Merged all indicator plugins into qtstalkerlib. Indicator plugins are now deprecated.

20070101: Merged TALIB into qtstalkerlib. The only change the user will notice is all indicators are available when creating

20070203: Upgraded ta-lib to version 0.3. ta-lib is using configure and has changed to a shared library, so we have to remove
          ta-lib from the qtstalker source and compile and install it as a separate package. This will be better for 
          the distribution maintainers as well.

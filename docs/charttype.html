<h2><u>Chart Type</u></h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Chart type is the type or 'style' of the main plot that the user wishes
to display. The available types are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bar - including normal Bar and Paint Bar</li>
  <li>Line - typical single price continuous line</li>
  <li>Candle - various types of Candle chart</li>
  <li>EP - Exhaustion Points</li>
  <li>PF - Point and Figure</li>
  <li>Swing - typical Gann-type Swing</li>
</ul>

<h3>General Notes</h3>
<p>
Each chart has a menu option called "ChartPrefs" (right-click on the
Qtstalker program chart window) to configure the preferences for that
particular chart type.
</p>

<h3>Bar</h3>
<p>The standard OHLC bar chart. Color is used to show up, down or no
change status from the previous bar.
The ChartPrefs menu enables choice of various types of Bar Chart,
e.g. Paint Bar.

<h3>Paint Bar</h3>
<p>Same as the Bar chart type except that the colors used are based on
the alert status rules of an active indicator. Used for showing
generalized support and resistance areas. For example, this paint bar
is
based on the MACD indicator. Notice how when the red MACD line rises
above the MACD yellow trigger line, the bars are green, meaning a buy
alert. When the MACD falls below the MACD trigger line, the bars are
colored red, meaning a sell alert.</p>

<h3>Line</h3>
<p>This chart is just a single line plot based on the day's close value.
The ChartPrefs menu enables choice of a different value, e.g. open price.

<h3>Candle</h3>
<p>
This is the standard candlestick chart.
An empty box (traditionally white) candle body means that the
close was higher than the open.
A solid (traditionally black) candle body means that the
close was lower than the open.
</p>
<p>
The ChartPrefs menu enables choice of various types of candle chart,
e.g. Candle, CandleQS, Volume Candle

<h3>CandleQS</h3>
<p>This is a custom candle chart.
An empty box (traditionally white) candle body means that the
close was higher than the open.
A solid (traditionally black) candle body means that the
close was lower than the open.
Colour adds another dimension. Red is a lower close than the previous
close.
Green is a higher close. Blue indicates no change from the previous
close.

<h3>Volume Candle</h3>
<p>Candles are specially coloured according to the day's volume.
</p>

<h3>EP - Exhaustion Points</h3>
<p>
When exhaustion points are reached, then a short-term reversal might be
indicated. See the separate documentation about
<a href="ep.html">exhaustion points</a>.
</p>

<h3>PF - Point and Figure</h3>
<p>Qtstalker version of Point and Figure uses a general box sizing
formula. The formula is calculated by taking the increment of the
current chart scale and divide that by 4. A 3 box reversal is also
used. The other difference is no X's or O's are used, instead we use
colors. Color up is used for X's and Color Down is used for O's. Much
easier to gauge at a glance and stays in keeping with other chart type
uses of color. Note that Qtstalker uses a time based style that allows
you to overlay indicators.</p>

<h3>Swing</h3>
<p>This is the typical Gann type swing chart. An up swing is colored
green. A down swing is colored red.

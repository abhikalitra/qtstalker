<h2><u>Chart Type</u></h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Chart type is the type or 'style' of the main plot the user wishes
to display. The available types are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bar Chart</li>
  <li>Paint Bar</li>
  <li>Line</li>
  <li>Candlestick</li>
  <li>Point and Figure</li>
  <li>Swing</li>
  <li>Exhaustion Points</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Bar Chart</h3>
<p>The standard OHLC bar chart. Color is used to show up, down or no
change status from the previous bar.</p>

<h3>Paint Bar</h3>
<p>Same as the Bar chart type except that the colors used are based on
the alert status rules of an active indicator. Used for showing
generalized support and resistance areas. For example, this paint bar is
based on the MACD indicator. Notice how when the red MACD line rises
above the MACD yellow trigger line, the bars are green, meaning a buy
alert. When the MACD falls below the MACD trigger line, the bars are
colored red, meaning a sell alert.</p>

<h3>Line</h3>
<p>This chart is just a single line plot based on the days close value.</p>

<h3>Candlestick</h3>
<p>This is the standard candlestick chart.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Point and Figure</h3>
<p>Qtstalker version of Point and Figure uses a general box sizing
formula. The formula is calculated by taking the increment of the
current chart scale  and divide that by 4. A 3 box reversal is also
used. The other difference is no X's or O's are used, instead we use
colors. Color up is used for X's and Color Down is used for O's. Much
easier to gauge at a glance and stays in keeping with other chart type
uses of color. Note that Qtstalker uses a time based style that allows
you to overlay indicators.</p>

<h3>Swing</h3>
<p>This is the typical Gann type swing chart.</p>

<h3>Exhaustion Points</h3>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> This chart type is experimental.
See <a href="exhaustion.html">more explanation</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Outside Bars" (yellow-to-red) - the trading range encompasses the previous bar.
"Inside Bars" (pink-to-blue) - the trading range is encompassed by the previous bar.
</p>
<p>
May indicate short-term reversal.
Must be accompanied by volume and preceded by a trend.
</p>
<p>
The outside bar at 20030313 is a classic. It is even more strong as it
encompasses both previous bars and has a large body.

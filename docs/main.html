<h2><u>Main Screen</u></h2>
<h2>  </h2>
  
<p>The figure below illustrates the what a typical Qtstalker app looks like. 
The basic parts of the app going from top to bottom are:</p>
 
<ol>
   <li>The title bar displays the current chart or group loaded.</li>
   <li>The menu bar, everything that can be done with Qtstalker can be done 
    using the menus.</li>
   <li>The tool bar area consists of 2 tool bars.      
    <ol>
       <li>Chart tool bar. Access to the most used charting functions like 
        chart types, bar spacing, grid etc.</li>
       <li>Navigation tool bar. This contains functions to navigate between 
        charts in a group, loading bar amounts etc.</li>
     
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li>Main chart. This is the main plot for Open, High, Low, Close data
for     every chart. Any indicators that apply to OHLC data will also be
plotted     here. eg Bollinger Bands, MA's etc.</li>
   <li>Indicator chart. Any indicators that don't apply to the main chart
will     be plotted here. eg. MACD, RSI etc. Note that the indicators located
here     are tabbed.</li>
 
</ol>
  
<p></p>
  
<p>Here is a shot of NASDAQ with a 3 plot MA and a MACD, OI and VOL at the 
bottom.</p>

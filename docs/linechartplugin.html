<h3>Line</h3>
<p>This chart is just a single line plot based on the day's close
value.
The ChartPrefs menu enables choice of a different value, e.g. open
price.

<br>
What is plotted can be changed to suit your needs by applying a custom
formula to generate the plot. <br>
<br>
<img style="width: 431px; height: 367px;" alt=""

<p>The Default Plot setting toggles the use of the user defined formula
with the default setting of the Close bar.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Here the above shot is a formula that creates the formula of (High +
Low + Close) / 3. Lets break it down into each step.<br>
Step 1 uses
the REF plugin to get an array of High bars.<br>
Step 2 uses
the REF plugin to get an array of Low bars.<br>
Step 3 uses
the REF plugin to get an array of Close bars.<br>
Step 4 uses
the MATH plugin to add steps 1 and 2 together.<br>
Step 5 uses
the MATH plugin to add steps 4 and 3 together to complete the (High +
Low + Close) portion of the formula.<br>
Step 6 uses the MATH plugin to divide steps 5 by 3. This step contains
the average price, and so we check the plot column to tell qtstalker
that this is the line we want to plot. </p>
We can plot any step we want just by checking the plot column desired.
If we want to show the actual close plot we would also check step 3.
It's up to you how complex you want to get.<br>

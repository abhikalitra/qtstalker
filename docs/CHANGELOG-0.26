20040221: Added new BarData class to libqtstalker. Plot and all plugins were modified to handle the new
          input bar interface. This structural change in preparation for future design changes.

20040222: Added a small current close arrow pointer to the scale area of the main plot. Helps with
          tracking where the last close is located on the scale.
	  
20040224: Moved chart object logic out of Plot:: and split each chart object off into it's own
          class. Moving towards a proper OO framework.

20040228: Moved PlotLine line type logic out of Plot:: and into PlotLine::
          Moving towards a proper OO framework.
	  
20040228: Moved chart type logic out of Plot:: and split each chart type off into it's own
          plugin. We now have chart plugins. Chart plugins now have their own pref dialogs
	  to handle colors and any parms that are specific to that chart style.
	  
20040228: Added new option to MACD plugin. Option controls the osc scaling. True turns on full
          scaling and false reverts to normal scaling.
	  
20040302: Yehaaww! Drag and drop chart objects are working. Needs some polishing and tweaking
          here and there still. But it works. This is a big step forward in usability. Overhauled
	  the Fibonacci and trendlines. 

20040303: Applied patch #909286 - thin and fat candles. Added an option to turn this feature on
          and off to compliment it. Thanks to Dany Daw.
	  
20040303: Applied patch #903981 - new doc explain cvs, development, contribution. Thanks to
          David Crossley.
	  
20040307: Added preference dialogs to all the quote plugins. Changed the quotes dialog to reflect
          this change. The settings interface to each quote plugin no longer displays in the
	  quote dialog. You need to press the settings button beside the plugin combobox to bring
	  up the settings dialog for each plugin.
	  
20040307: Folded YahooQuote plugin into Yahoo plugin. Removed YahooQuote quote plugin.
	  
20040308: Removed Price indicator plugin. Now redundant because of the Line chart plugin can replace
          it's functions.

20040309: Added an option to save the minimum bar spacing for each chart plugin. When you change
          chart types, the minimum bar spacing for that type will be the default.
	  
20040309: Last chart plugin used is now restored between sessions.

20040310: Config settings were not being saved when the WM kills the app. Fixed.

20040310: Fixed the plotting on tabbed indicators that left a space above the date if a date area
          was requested.

20040313: Converted all indicator plugins to the new dialog format. This conversion removes storage
          of indicator settings from the rc file to individual flat ascii files that are stored
	  in the new ~/Qtstalker/indicator directory. This allows greater flexibilty for
	  manipulating indicator plugins, no longer being tied to Settings:: class internally.
	  Just tell the plugin where the settings file is and it will load and configure
	  itself to it.

20040313: Converted the indicator EP plugin to a new EP chart plugin. The chart plugin is now
          better suited. Removing the EP indicator.
	  
20040322: Completed intraday quote conversion to all classes. Intraday quotes up to the minute
          can now be used. All that is needed is an app that can update the charts with quotes.
	  Will be updating the CSV and Yahoo plugins to use them in the future.
	  
20040322: Updated the GUI to use new chart compression formats of 5/15/30/60 minute charts if 
          minute bar quotes are available.
	  
20040322: Replaced the Bars combobox on the toolbar with a spinbox to better control the number of bars
          to load.
	  
20040324: Overhauled the CSV plugin to allow for users to create thier own input file format rules.
          Need to update the docs on how to do this. You create a new rule and insert the field
	  format of the ascii file into the Rule Contents list. The fields in the list should match
	  the fields in the ascii file from top to bottom in the list. Probably should create some
	  default formats for users to play with initially.

20040324: Consolidated PaintBar plugin into the Bar plugin. Removed PaintBar plugin.

20040324: Consolidated CandleQS plugin into the Candle plugin. Removed CandleQS plugin.

20040324: Modified patch #911112 - volume candle plugin - and pulled it into the Candle plugin.
          Thanks to Dany Daw for this cool patch.
	  
20040326: Modified indicator plugins to use QSMath class for often used TA functions.

20040330: Added function to toggle the crosshairs from the chart context menu.

20040330: Draw mode state is now saved between sessions.

20040331: Added a drawing function to allow the user to draw in newly created trendlines and
          fibo's instead of just clicking the start and end points.

20040401: Added a set defaults function for chart objects. Each object type can have set
          defaults when created. So far, only color and font are defaulted.

20040410: After much discussion the chart object user interface has a workable method now.
          Left mouse click to select an object. An object is selected when 1 or more boxes
	  appear next or on top of it. Left mouse click a selected object on any of the boxes
	  will put object into move mode. Move mode then tracks the position of the mouse pointer
	  allowing drag and drop action of the object. To place the object a left mouse
	  click on the point you wish to drop it. Right mouse click with a selected object
	  brings up the context menu. To unselect an object just click anywhere else on the chart
	  other than the bounds of the chart object currently selected. A double left mouse click
	  on a selection brings up the edit dialog. Keyboard shortcuts for a selected object are
	  CTRL-E for edit dialog, CTRL-M for move mode and CTRL-D for object delete.
	  
20040428: Fixed chart object scaling when scale to screen is true. Now objects only appear if
          they fall within the bar price range on screen. If scale to screen is false, all chart
	  objects will appear.
	  
20040428: Moved the "Tab Position Top" parm from prefs menu to a context menu activated by
          mouse right click on the indicator tab area. 
	  	  
20040428: Moved the "Navigator Position Left" parm from prefs menu to a context menu activated by
          mouse right click on the navigator tab area. 
	  
20040506: Added key accels to menus and dialog buttons.

20040520: Added a version number to plugin file names. Will use the file versions to control
          proper plugin loading. Note the plugin filename is slightly different than dynamic lib
	  naming convention due to qmake ignoring the version parm when building plugins.
	  
20040523: Merged CMEHistory plugin into CME plugin.

20040527: Yahoo changed historical url. Updated yahoo plugin.

20040528: Applied patch #962153 - remove deprectaed qt2 features. Thanks to Marco for this
          patch.
	  	  
20040602: Applied patches #963998, 963987, 963961 - doc updates.
